      <p>
        While she was out stealing, Mia had taken a trip to the library and
        “borrowed” a book, which she promptly read.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p><em>Tyll'a's Notes: In game, this was a career book.</em></p>
      <p>
        After reading the book and before heading out, she decided to work out a
        bit.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Mia working out.png" />
      <p>
        One thing Arthur and Mia were sure about was that they both wanted to
        have a child – to continue the Azul line and the mermaid species.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arthur and Mia were on pretty much opposite sleeping schedules, with
        Arthur playing his guitar during the day and Mia stealing at night.
        Arthur didn’t know that Mia was stealing; he thought she had gotten a
        graveyard-shift job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: In game, that’s exactly what happened; it just so
          happens that that graveyard-shift job is in the Criminal career.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>They still did, however, find time for each other.</p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        Arthur stated riding his bike to the park instead of taking a car; he
        liked the feel of the wind in his hair.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Arthur likes to bike.png"
      />
      <p>The next day, Mia wasn’t feeling all that well…</p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Mia pukes.png" />
      <p>She thought a good workout might help her feel better.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Mia working out again.png"
      />
      <p>Finally, she realized what was going on!</p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Mia is pregnant.png" />
      <p>
        With that good news, Arthur and Mia decided to expand their small house
        in order to add a child’s room, as well as give themselves the space for
        a proper double bed.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/House screenshot.png" />
      <p>
        As Mia couldn’t go out and steal while pregnant, she went to the library
        and borrowed another book.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Mia reading another book.png"
      />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Again, a career opportunity book. And yes, Mia is on
          maternity leave.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Before they knew it, Mia was ready to deliver her baby. Arthur and Mia
        went to the hospital together and left with a new baby mermaid girl. Mia
        named her new daughter Maya, after her lost sister and Wavespeaker.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Maya is born.fw.png" />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Hydrophobic on a mermaid? This will be interesting.
          Although, I did have to use MasterController to make Maya a
          mermaid.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        However, before they left, the doctor told Mia some bad news. There had
        been some complications with Maya’s delivery; Mia would never be able to
        have another child.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was more bad news when they got home; a rival thief had entered
        their home and was in the process of stealing something; luckily for Mia
        and Arthur, the thief left without stealing anything.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Yes, that was actually the Repo Man; I got a bit
          careless with my play. Again. Also, this is the downside of having
          stars; Mia got a -30 moodlet for my careless play.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>Arthur and Mia were the happiest parents in the world.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter2/Taking care of Maya - both.fw.png"
      />
      <p>
        But it wouldn’t last. When Mia went out for a swim and didn’t come back,
        Arthur had to face the fact:
      </p>
      <p>Mia was missing.</p>
