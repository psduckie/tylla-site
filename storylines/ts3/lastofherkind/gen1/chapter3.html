        It felt weird for Arthur to sleep alone in that double bed. But sleep
        eventually did find him, and dreams did likewise. He dreamt of a unicorn
        – a manifestation of Glenda, aspect of nature – running through a snowy
        field, light trailing behind. And the unicorn spoke to him in his dream.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Dream sequence.png" />
      <p>[Unicorn] &quot;To find who you seek, go to this location…&quot;</p>
      <p>
        When Arthur awoke, he remembered where the unicorn had told him to go.
        He got on his bike and rode into the sunrise…
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile…</p>
      <p>
        Mia swam through the pool – no, the cage – that she was in. At least her
        captor was kind enough to provide water, but it was fresh water. She
        didn’t know how long she had been there, but she did know that if she
        stayed too long, she would die of salt-water deficiency.
      </p>
      <p>Mia did not want to die.</p>
      <p>
        As Mia was contemplating her situation, she heard a knock on the side of
        the cage. Looking down, she saw a woman with bright green wings.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Mia captured.PNG" />
      <p>[Mia (thinking)] <em>A fairy…</em></p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Mia should have a tail instead of her legs when
          swimming; this is a bug.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>Mia swam closer to the fairy.</p>
      <p>[Mia] &quot;Where are we?&quot;</p>
      <p>
        [Fairy] &quot;I wish I knew exactly. What I do know is that this crazy
        human knocked me out, and the next thing I knew, I was locked up here.
        By the way, I’m Ceuj of the house of Silvergryphon, and this is my
        daughter Llanye.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>[Mia] &quot;I’m Mia Azul. Now how do we get out of here…&quot;</p>
      <p>[Ceuj] &quot;Quick, act like nothing’s happening! He’s back!&quot;</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Mr Crazy walks in.PNG"
      />
      <p>[Crazy Man] &quot;Ah, my pets…&quot;</p>
      <p>Meanwhile…</p>
      <p>
        Arthur continued to ride his bike through the snowy day, desperately
        seeking to find the location that the unicorn had hinted Mia would be
        at.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Bike sequence.png" />
      <p>
        And he finally made it there. As he walked into the unassuming building,
        he saw Mia trapped in an enclosure. He also saw the unicorn from his
        dreams, also trapped, and a fairy mother and child. Unfortunately, their
        captor was in the building as well.
      </p>
      <p>[Arthur] &quot;Let Mia go!&quot;</p>
      <p>
        [Crazy Man] &quot;Is this daughter of Shari a friend of yours? She has
        everything she needs here.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Arthur walked up to the wall of the enclosure and felt it. It was made
        of acrylic – plastic. The Toxin.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Arthur] &quot;What the hell are you doing? Let! Her! Go! Now!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>[Crazy Man] &quot;Why would I do that?&quot;</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Arthur arguing with Mr. Crazy.png"
      />
      <p>
        Words turned to blows, as Arthur and the crazy man got into a fight,
        which Arthur won.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Arthur and Mr. Crazy fighting.png"
      />
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Arthur kicked Mr. Crazy's tail.png"
      />
      <p>
        Arthur then cut a hole in the wall of the tank holding Mia, releasing
        both her and all the water in the tank. The flood was enough for the
        other captives to break out as well.
      </p>
      <p>[Ceuj] &quot;By the honor of my house, I will see you dead!&quot;</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Ceuj and Mr. Crazy fighting.png"
      />
      <p>
        But that was not to be. As Ceuj lay dying, she looked to Arthur and Mia.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Ceuj dying.png" />
      <p>[Ceuj] &quot;Please…take care…of my…Llanye…&quot;</p>
      <p>And with that, Ceuj of the house of Silvergryphon died.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter3/Grim comes for Ceuj.png"
      />
      <p>[Mia] &quot;Thanks for saving me! But…&quot;</p>
      <p>[Arthur] &quot;You’re sad about the fairy?&quot;</p>
      <p>
        [Mia] &quot;Yes. She was my only friend in this hell. And now, she’s
        dead.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mia picked up the now-orphaned fairy child Llanye, and she and Arthur
        exited the building to go home.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tyll'a's Notes: Yes, Llanye is the spare for this generation.</em>
