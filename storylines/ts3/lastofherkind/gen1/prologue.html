      <h2 class="responsiveHeader">Prologue</h2>
      <p>
        It all started with Sims that were not careful about where they put
        their trash. Over a period of decades, littered items, most of which
        were plastic, washed into the Western Ocean, causing untold devastation
        to the environment. Entire species died out, and one more was about to
        follow suit…
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Western Ocean was a mostly abandoned mermaid city. Only four
        mermaids remained; the rest had fallen to what they called the Toxin –
        what was known to human Sims as plastic. Maya, the Wavespeaker (as the
        mermaids called their priests) of the remaining mermaids, divined a
        prophecy: “One from sea and one from land, shall save the People from a
        Toxic fate.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Arthur Starre, a scientist studying the litter, had developed a
        substance that would cause the plastic to congeal into an artificial
        island. He was on his boat, about to use his masterpiece, when something
        happened. A mermaid surfaced right in front of his boat! It was Triton,
        king of the mermaid city and father of Maya.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Triton] “Why are you here, human?”<br />
        [Arthur] “I am here to clean up the plastic that litters the ocean.”
      </p>
      <p>With that, Triton dove underwater once again to consult with Maya.</p>
      <p>
        [Triton] “I think that’s him – the ‘one from land’ that you were
        speaking about!”<br />
        [Maya] “He said he’s cleaning the place?”<br />
        [Triton] “Yes!”<br />
        [Maya] “There’s a problem, though. As you know, most of us already have
        too much Toxin in our systems. If we wait for this human to clean it all
        up, even Mia will have succumbed.”<br />
        [Triton] “Then what do we do?”<br />
        [Maya] “There’s only one thing we can do. Get the human to take Mia to
        safer waters. Then…hopefully…they can rebuild our people.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Triton’s other daughter, Mia, swam in as the conversation was ending.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Mia] “Maya asked you to do what?”<br />
        [Triton] “Because of all the time you spent at the surface, breathing
        air instead of Toxin-infested water, you’re the only one that can save
        our people. Maya, Salty, and I all have too much Toxin in our systems.
        The human sailing in our waters is the ‘one from land’ that Maya
        prophesied. The ‘one from sea’ is you.”<br />
        [Mia] “But I don’t want to leave you!”<br />
        [Triton] “You would be leaving me either way…I don’t have much time
        left. Now, let’s go to the surface.”
      </p>
      <p>Triton and Mia resurfaced, and Triton told Arthur the news.</p>
      <p>
        [Triton] “My people are dying. The Toxin – what you called ‘plastic’ –
        has been too much for us. Only my daughter Mia is safe. But if she does
        not leave this ocean, and soon, even she will fall to the Toxin.”<br />
        [Triton] “I will give you my daughter in marriage if you promise to take
        her to an unpolluted ocean, so that my people can once again thrive.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Mia was beautiful, and Arthur didn’t want another species to die out
        because of human carelessness. There was only one option.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Arthur] “I promise.”<br />
        [Triton] “Now go…find an unpolluted ocean…save our…people…”
      </p>
      <p>Triton’s corpse sank into the sea. Mia was distraught.</p>
      <p>
        [Mia] “Father!!!”<br />
        [Arthur] “Let’s go…it’s what your father wanted.”<br />
        [Mia] “Yes…you’re right.”
      </p>
      <p>
        After sailing for some time, the two arrived at the island of Sunlit
        Tides, far from the plastic-infested waters. They bought a house near
        the beach, and Arthur changed his last name. Mermaids did not have last
        names in their own society, but they were living among humans now. They
        became Arthur and Mia Azul, the last hopes of the mermaid people.
