      <h2>Chapter 1: Welcome to Sunlit Tides</h2>
      <p>
        Upon arriving in Sunlit Tides, Arthur and Mia knew that they would have
        to find some way to get money. The funds that Arthur had saved for his
        expedition were nearly gone, and mermaids hadn’t used money since the
        Toxin decimated their people. Arthur decided that he would use his
        guitar skills to play for tips. Mia didn’t want to do anything to help
        humans (with the exception of Arthur) but she knew that she wouldn’t
        survive without doing something. So, she looked back to mermaid history
        to think of something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the Toxin, there was an order of female mermaids whose job it was
        to use their beauty to lure human men to a life of servitude beneath the
        waves, doing the jobs that were too menial for mermaid hands. The
        Sirens, as they were called, had disbanded after the Toxin appeared and
        killed many of their members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mia had no intention of enslaving anyone, but she did intend to use her
        beauty to steal from human men. As far as she was concerned, they
        deserved it for unleashing the Toxin on her people. She wouldn’t tell
        Arthur about it, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: In game, Mia joined the Criminal career (and will be
          taking the Thief branch, as that is what I rolled and she is stealing
          as opposed to doing evil); unlike in-game, she is working alone in the
          storyline.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        As Mia was exploring the island, Arthur practiced his guitar to get the
        rust out.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Finally, Mia got home. Both Arthur and Mia were quite hungry, and they
        hadn’t been able to find any kelp – the favorite food of mermaids – that
        wasn’t contaminated with the Toxin. Arthur promised to Mia that he would
        make something that she would like, and he did.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Arthur makes Mac and Cheese.png"
      />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: This is the Homemade roll being annoying. As a
          player, I really wanted to have Mia eat kelp, but I couldn’t find any
          recipes that used it.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Their house didn’t have room for a proper double bed, so Arthur bought a
        bunk bed for the two of them.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/The bunk bed.png" />
      <p>
        The next day, Mia went out again, ostensibly to explore, but actually to
        steal. She stayed out a little too long, though, and collapsed of
        dehydration on her way back home. Luckily, she was able to call Arthur,
        who hurried and splashed water on her, then helped her get home.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Mia is not dead.png" />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Yes, that is what it looks like: Mia came very close
          to dying. If I hadn’t intervened and sent Arthur to save her, she
          would have died – on day 2 of the legacy!</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        From then on, Mia was <strong>very</strong> careful about not getting
        dehydrated! But she did get into the newspaper.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Sunlit Tide - Mia collapses.png"
      />
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Mia gets a star.png" />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: One star already? It’s the first week of the legacy,
          and I wasn’t even trying for stars!</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Mia’s troubles with water, however, were far from over. She knew that
        without saltwater in her system, she could die just as easily as she
        almost did when she was dehydrated. And she was running low, so she took
        a trip to the beach and played in the ocean – the clean ocean – for a
        bit.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Mia at the beach.png" />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Mia does not know the complete truth about that game
          mechanic. She would not die; she would just turn human. However, what
          she had been taught is that she would die.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Arthur finally got to the point where he was comfortable playing for
        tips, and he was first going to go over to City Hall and turn in the
        final papers to get a business license. He wasn’t sure whether he
        actually needed it, but he felt it would be better safe than sorry. Mia
        volunteered to turn in the papers, and so she did.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Arthur hits Guitar 5.png"
      />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: Mia actually had a career opportunity that involved
          going to City Hall. But since the career is in-game only, I needed a
          reason for her to go storyline-wise.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        And with that done, Arthur went to the Summer Festival to play some
        music. He wasn’t going to let a little thing like illness stop him!
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Arthur is ill.png" />
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Arthur playing for tips.png"
      />
      <p>
        The day after that was Leisure Day. But it may as well have been Love
        Day, as Arthur and Mia decided to consummate their marriage on that day.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/First WooHoo.png" />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: There still isn’t enough room in the house for a
          proper double bed. I do plan on eventually fixing that. On another
          note, I have Risky WooHoo on, so I don’t know when Generation 2 will
          be coming.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, their…action…was a bit too much for the shower.
        Fortunately, Arthur could repair it.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Fixing the shower.png"
      />
      <p>
        <em
          >Tyll'a's Notes: In game, the shower actually broke the day after the
          WooHoo happened.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day was a rainy day. Arthur decided not to go to the festival
        grounds and play because of that; instead, he spent his time practicing
        at home.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/lastofherkind/chapter1/Not going to play in the rain.png"
      />
      <p>And so ends Arthur and Mia’s first week in Sunlit Tides.</p>
