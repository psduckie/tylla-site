      <h3>February 10, 2014</h3>
      <p>“Duncan?”</p>
      <p>
        It was her! My one and only friend during my time with the vampires! But
        what was she doing in Dragon Valley?
      </p>
      <p>“What are you doing here, Tyla? Why are you not with your family?”</p>
      <p>
        “I can’t take being with them anymore. You know just as well as I do
        what they’re like! I want to be with you!”
      </p>
      <p>“Won’t your mother be looking for you?”</p>
      <p>
        “I told her I was going to look for you and bring you back. But I’m not
        going to do that! I didn’t realize what you mean to me until you
        escaped!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Did Tyla just admit she had feelings for me? I definitely had feelings
        for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought a moment. Then I remembered something that Dampe had told me:
        if I took responsibility for any misdeeds Tyla committed (of which there
        would be none – this is Tyla we are talking about, after all), she can
        stay. “You can stay at my house, Tyla.”
      </p>
      <p>“Thank you so much, Duncan!”</p>
      <p>
        I had work soon after that, and the spirits were hiding from me this
        time. It didn’t work.
      </p>

      <p>They were also getting stronger!</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter5/Duncan busts a ghost.png"
      />
      <p>
        As the days went on, the spirits got harder and harder to stop. By the
        time I could go home to Tyla, I was too tired to do anything except
        sleep!
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Finally, the Love Day festival came. No work! I was able to spend the
        day with Tyla! One thing led to another…
      </p>

      />
      <p>Two days later, Tyla told me the good news over a game of chess.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter5/Tyla tells Duncan the good news.png"
      />
      <p>“I’m pregnant.”</p>
      <p>
        The question stuck in my mind: would our child be a vampire like Tyla?
