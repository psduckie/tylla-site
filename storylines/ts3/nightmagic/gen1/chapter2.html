      <h3>December 20, 2013</h3>
      <p>
        The day of the festival arrived. I called Sophie to see if she wanted to
        meet up at the festival grounds.

      <p>
        “I’m sorry, Duncan. My mother wouldn’t approve of us being together.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t even know what exactly was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know how it works where you’re from, but here in Dragon Valley,
        the parents have to sanction relationships. I’m sorry. I really am.”
      </p>

      />
      <p>An hour or so later, I got my mail. There was a letter from Dampe:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Duncan:</p>
        <p>Enjoy the festival! You don’t have to come into work today.</p>
        <p>-Dampe</p>
      </blockquote>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter2/Duncan at the park.png"
      />
      <p>Enjoying the festival is exactly what I did.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter2/Duncan on the treadmill.png"
      />
      <p>After the festival, I decided to go to the gym.</p>
      <p>
        When I went to school the next day, I tried to forget about what
        happened with Sophie before the festival. But it was still on my mind.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter2/Fixing the TV.png"
      />
      <p>
        The next day was a Saturday, so I didn’t have school. At least that was
        the same. But the old TV in the house was broken, so I had to do what I
        could to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>I did, however, have work. Work was the same as always.</p>
