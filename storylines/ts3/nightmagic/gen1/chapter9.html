      <p>The next night, Tyla’s ghost woke me up.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ve been gathering what strength I have left so that I can come back
        to you for good. I love you, Duncan.”
      </p>
      <p>That afternoon, Samantha walked up to me.</p>
      <p>
        “I’ve never had any friends in school. Everyone always knew me as the
        half-vampire girl. So, when I found that I could use the chemistry set
        to make Tyler real, I went for it!”
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter9/Tyler is real!.png" />
      <p>
        “Tyler, will you be my boyfriend?” He responded to her in the
        affirmative; I was excited to see my daughter finally in a relationship!
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day, I got a note from the school asking if Samantha and Tyler
        could go on a field trip. Of course I accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        That afternoon, right before work, I checked the mail and got a letter
        and certificate congratulating me on my chess skills!

        There must have been something that I was allergic to at one of the Ward
        breaches that I deal with; I was sneezing my lungs out by the time they
        were all gone. Luckily, the hospital had a vaccine to deal with that.
      </p>

      <p>Tyla’s ghost was coming more and more often now.</p>

      <p>
        After Samantha got back from the field trip, she started playing her
        guitar. She was getting good at it!
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day, Samantha was sound asleep when the school bus came. She
        did eventually go to school, but I wasn’t happy.
      </p>

        Most of the rest of the week was uneventful. However, on Saturday, the
        town saw fit to give me another award!
