      <p>
        As I entered the graveyard (fresh air, at last!) I heard a voice calling
        out. It definitely wasn’t one of the vampires; I knew those voices too
        well. I looked towards the voice and saw an old man tending the
        graveyard.
      </p>
      <p>“Hey, kid! What are you doing there?”</p>
      <p>“Are they still following me?”</p>
      <p>“Who?”</p>
      <p>“The vampires!”</p>
      <p>
        “Don’t be silly, kid! There’s a ward that keeps this town vampire-free!
        Come to think of it, I haven’t seen you around. I’m Dampe.”
      </p>
      <p>“I’m Duncan. Where am I, exactly? I need to get home!”</p>
      <p>
        “You’re in Dragon Valley, kid. Far west of SimNation. And I doubt there
        would be any ‘home’ for you to go back to. Most of SimNation’s now a
        vampire-filled mess.”
      </p>
      <p>I realized the town I once knew was gone. And my face showed it.</p>
      <p>
        “Is there any place I can stay? Being here in this town would be better
        than out there with the vampires.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sure, kid. There’s an old abandoned house at 81 Claddagh Court. No
        one’s lived there for decades. I doubt anyone would mind if you stayed
        there.”
      </p>
      <p>“Thanks, Dampe!”</p>
      <p>
        “No problem, kid. By the way, if you need some money, come by here
        tomorrow. I could use a helper here at the graveyard.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I walked across town to the address that Dampe had mentioned and found
        the abandoned house. It was old, all right. Old and a complete mess. At
        least it was better than that vampire cave.
      </p>

      <p>Man, it was nice to sleep in a real bed.</p>

      <p>
        The next day, I went to the school to register as a student. They
        immediately had a class for me to join! I got to meet some of the other
        students, but I was mostly focused on my studies and my job at the
        graveyard. One of my classmates was a really hot girl…her name was
        Sophie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two days after I joined the class, the teacher told us that there would
        be no class the next day because of a festival. That festival could be
        the perfect chance to get to know Sophie!
