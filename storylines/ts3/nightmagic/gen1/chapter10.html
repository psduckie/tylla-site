      />
      <p>It finally happened. Tyla came back, and this time for good.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan and Tyla sleeping together.png"
      />
      <p>
        Who would have thought I would be comfortable in this situation? But
        she’s back, and that’s what matters.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan throwing newspapers in the trash.png"
      />
      <p>
        As I went to throw away some old issues of The Dragon Valley Oracle, I
        noticed that things were becoming harder than they used to be. Was this
        Sabriel’s doing, or was I just getting old?
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan talking to Samantha.png"
      />
      <p>
        As I realized that it was indeed me getting old, I told Samantha
        everything that had happened between Tyla, Sabriel, and myself. I told
        her how I met Tyla. I told her about Tyla’s murder at the hands of
        Morida. But most importantly, I told her about the evil that was Sabriel
        – her grandmother.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Tyla proposes to Duncan.png"
      />
      <p>
        Talk about a surprise – Tyla proposed to me! In SimNation, it was always
        the men that proposed to the women, but I knew from the time that I had
        spent with the vampires that with them, it was the other way around. Of
        course, I accepted the proposal!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan and Tyla playing chess.png"
      />
      <p>I treasured every moment I spent with her.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan busting a ghost.png"
      />
      <p>
        As I dealt with yet another Ward breach, I wondered how long I would be
        able to handle them, and whether my apprentices would be up to the job.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Another rejected flirt toward Duncan.png"
      />
      <p>
        One of the people that I helped tried to flirt with me. Of course, being
        engaged, I turned her down.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan invites Samantha and Tyler to tour MLLF.png"
      />
      <p>
        Because of my history with M.L.L.F., I was able to get a tour for
        Samantha and Tyler.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Miles grows to YA.png"
      />
      <p>
        And Miles’ apprenticeship was complete. He was ready to take on Ward
        breaches on his own. He moved out and into a house that I had prepared
        for the apprentices to live in.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan works on upgrading the sink.png"
      />
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan upgrading the TV.png"
      />
      <p>Yet there were still upgrades to make around the house.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Tyler's opportunity to research MLLF.png"
      />
      <p>
        Tyler let me know that the school gave him an assignment to research
        M.L.L.F. and asked me to help him with it, which I agreed to do.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Aubrey Lawless passed out in the bathroom.png"
      />
      <p>
        Later, something weird happened: an old man walked into the house and
        passed out in the bathroom! I guess he must have lost his memory or
        something and thought it was his house; I woke him up and helped him get
        to his actual house.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Samantha's bathroom guitar jam.png"
      />
      <p>
        Samantha was playing beautiful music on her guitar…in the bathroom. She
        was getting really good with that guitar, but seriously? In the
        bathroom?
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Mildred grows to YA.png"
      />
      <p>
        Just like Miles before her, Mildred finished her apprenticeship and was
        named a full Warden.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Samantha entertains while Duncan fixes the TV.png"
      />
      <p>
        The TV broke while everyone was watching it! While I was fixing the TV,
        Samantha came in and started playing her guitar.
      </p>
      <p>At the end of that day, there was a lot of celebrating to be done.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Mimi grows to YA.png"
      />
      <p>First, Mimi’s apprenticeship ended and I named her a full Warden.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Samantha grows to YA.png"
      />
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Tyler grows to YA.png"
      />
      <p>Second, Samantha and Tyler grew into adults.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter10/Duncan grows to Elder.png"
      />
      <p>And finally…I became an elder.</p>
      <p>
        This is my last entry; Samantha told me she wants to take over writing
        these.
