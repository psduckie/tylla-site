        The next day, I put more time into making my home a little bit better.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night at work, I put in even more effort than I had been putting
        in, hoping that Dampe would say that I was ready to protect the town. My
        hopes were in vain that night, although he did notice the work I was
        doing.
      </p>
      <p>“Keep it up, kid!”</p>
      <p>
        When I went to get the mail the next morning, the ground was covered
        with snow! School was cancelled because of the bad weather, so I spent
        the time working on the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing an upgrade on the stove, I decided to have some fun and
        build an igloo.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        It wasn’t the same as back in Appaloosa Plains with my family. To add to
        the homesickness, a wild horse showed up in front of my house. There
        were always horses like that in Appaloosa Plains. In all my time in
        Dragon Valley, I had never felt so alone as that day.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter4/The wild horse.png" />
      <p>
        The weather had cleared up a bit by the time I had to go to work. I was
        glad to get out of the house, and at work, Dampe finally said what I was
        hoping he’d say!
      </p>
      <p>
        “Kid, I think you’re ready. Meet me at the Myth, Legend, Lore, and Fact
        Facility tomorrow.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I could not believe it. I had a hard time finding one, but I went to a
        clothing store and bought some new clothes. I wasn’t going to go to the
        new job with the tattered clothes I had come to Dragon Valley in!
      </p>
      <p>
        My time at the school was also at an end. It turned out that I, out of
        everyone, was named valedictorian!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter4/Valedictorian Duncan.png"
      />
      <p>
        Before the vampire attack, I didn’t have much of an appreciation for
        school. But during my time with the vampires, I wasn’t allowed any
        education. I hadn’t realized how much I liked school until it was taken
        from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the ceremony, I went to the Myth, Legend, Lore, and Fact Facility
        to meet Dampe.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You made it, kid. I’ll teach you the ropes of maintaining the ward.
        First is finding and stopping the spirits that the vampires send into
        Dragon Valley; second is bringing them back here. One more thing…”
      </p>
      <p>
        Dampe walked out of the room for a bit, then came back with a sword, a
        weird-looking device, and a badge.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This device safely captures the spirits. Once you bring them back here,
        we can free them from the vampires’ evil. The sword, I hope you’ll never
        need. It’s for a vampire, should one get through. And the badge…”
      </p>
      <p>Dampe touched the flat end of the sword to my shoulder.</p>
      <p>
        “Duncan, I hereby name you a Warden of Dragon Valley. Wear it proudly.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the week went by quickly. M.L.L.F. would detect a breach and
        send me to the location, it would just be a group of minor spirits, I
        would catch them and bring them back to M.L.L.F. to be freed.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        I did this two or three times a day until Saturday, when I was sent to
        the graveyard. The breach there was anything but minor – it was a
        full-fledged vampire! I was about to draw my sword when I recognized her
        face. Could it be?
      </p>
      <p>“Tyla?”</p>
