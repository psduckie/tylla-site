      <h3>January 2, 2014</h3>
      <p>The next day, I decided to go fishing.</p>

      />
      <p>
        After a bit of fishing, I went to the Myth, Legend, Lore, and Fact
        facility, where I saw a familiar face. It was Dampe! Although I didn’t
        know what exactly they were talking about, I couldn’t help but overhear
        some of his conversation with one of the M.L.L.F. staff members.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Dampe, you’re the last of the Order. You have to find a successor!”
      </p>
      <p>“I know, I know. I’m working on it!”</p>
      <p>
        What were they talking about? When I got to work that evening, I asked
        Dampe. His answer surprised me.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Kid, I told you about the ward that keeps the vampires out. Well,
        someone has to maintain it, and that someone is me. The problem is that
        I’m getting old and I haven’t found someone to take over once I’m gone.
        Without anyone maintaining the ward, the vampires will descend on Dragon
        Valley, and it will all be over.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I was shocked. I couldn’t lose this newfound home! I just couldn’t! I
        knew exactly what to do.
      </p>
      <p>“Can I help maintain the ward?”</p>
      <p>
        “Not right now, kid. You’re too young. But when you get old enough,
        yes.”
      </p>
      <p>That was exactly the answer I was hoping for.</p>
      <p>
        The rest of the week was a blur. When I wasn’t at school, I was at work.
        Finally, Saturday came – no school. I spent the time first fixing the TV
        (the thing had broken again!)…
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>…then tinkering with various objects…</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter3/Duncan upgrading the tub.png"
      />
      <p>…and finally going to work.</p>
      <p>
        What would the next week bring? And when would I finally be old enough
        to help maintain the ward?
