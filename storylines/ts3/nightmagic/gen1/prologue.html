      <h3>November 28, 2013</h3>
      <p>It all started with the war.</p>
      <p>
        I still don’t know why the vampires of Moonlight Falls attacked
        SimNation. But they did. And town after town fell to their murderous
        rampage.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hometown of Appaloosa Plains was one of the towns that fell. My
        parents were fighting in the war when it fell, leaving me in the care of
        the local school – the local school that was one of the first places to
        be attacked. The vampires rounded up the students and shipped us off to
        a cavern lair – to be used as slaves and food.
      </p>
      <p>I’m Duncan Nightmagic, and this is my story.</p>
      <p>
        Five years. That’s how long I spent in that cavernous hell, waiting for
        a chance to escape. I was traded from vampire to vampire like a piece of
        meat. Eventually, however, I saw an opportunity and made a break for it.
        I ran through the caverns, taking every uphill turn I could, coming out
        into a graveyard – but not the Appaloosa Plains graveyard! Where was I?
        And more importantly, were the vampires giving chase?
