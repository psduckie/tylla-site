          >Yes, I know I said I’d introduce Generation 2 in the next chapter,
          and I still plan on doing so in Chapter 6. But some game glitchiness
          kept me from being able to take the pictures for Chapter 6 today, so
          here’s a bonus chapter from Tyla’s point of view. It starts during the
          Prologue and shows how the two met, as well as some backstory. Enjoy.

        How did I, princess of the vampires, end up living in Dragon Valley with
        a human man?
      </p>
      <p>I’m Tylarael K’ien’sha, and this is my story.</p>
      <p>
        It all started when I was just a fledgling. I was an only child, and my
        mother the Queen had just successfully led an invasion of the human town
        of Appaloosa Plains. I had been trying to find someone to play with for
        a while at that point, so when she gave me a captured human boy, I was
        extremely happy. His name was Duncan, and we became close friends. That
        is, until mother sold him three years later. I was upset, but I couldn’t
        do anything about it. After all, she was the Queen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew to see what was wrong with vampire society and eventually, I
        heard that Duncan had escaped. I realized that I missed him and worked
        to figure out where he went, so I could be with him once again…
