      <p>
        After seeing Sabriel at the graveyard, I knew that I would have to learn
        more if I were to face her again. So I went back to the chess table. It
        also felt like Tyla was watching me when I was at that chess table.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Duncan at the chess table.png"
      />
      <p>
        Later that day, there was a celebration at City Hall! They were
        celebrating my getting Sabriel to leave! What’s better, at the
        celebration, I let them know what Tyla had told me and they arrested
        Morida!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Celebration for Duncan.png"
      />
      <p>
        Because I and my three apprentices had all been competing for space at
        the chess table, I decided to get another one.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/The newly expanded living room.png"
      />
      <p>
        And we were all able to play chess! It’s amazing how much you learn from
        that game.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/They all play chess.png"
      />
      <p>
        In addition to the new chess table, I also had bought a new kitchen
        table and built a new bathroom.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/The new kitchen table.png"
      />
      <p>And there were still some things only I could do.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Ghostbusting.  Again..png"
      />
      <p>While I was at work, Miles grew into a teenager!</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Miles grows to Teen.png"
      />
      <p>
        And when I got home, one of my apprentices managed to break the bathtub
        while I was sleeping.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Who broke the tub....png"
      />
      <p>
        After discovering the broken tub, I went to check the mail and found a
        letter saying I had won a free vacation.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/A trap from Sabriel.png"
      />
      <p>
        That would have been nice had I not recognized the handwriting. It was
        Sabriel, and there was no way that I was going to fall for her trap!
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Miles was old enough now, I decided to train him the way Dampe had
        trained me.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Miles and the part-time job.png"
      />
      <p>And I finally got around to fixing that broken bathtub!</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Duncan fixes the tub.png"
      />
      <p>
        After fixing the tub, I got a call from Samantha. Apparently, the Dragon
        Valley Wyverns had a raffle at the school and she and a friend had won
        free tickets! She wanted permission to go to her friend’s house and the
        game, which I granted.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Samantha goes to Aubrey's house and the Wyverns game.png"
      />
      <p>
        That day’s mail included two love letters. My heart still belonged to,
        and always will belong to, Tyla.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Duncan throws away unwanted love letters.png"
      />
      <p>
        After checking the mail, I went to deal with some Ward breaches and was
        surprised when a baby was born right in front of my eyes!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/A baby in a haunted house.png"
      />
      <p>The next day, Mildred grew into a teen – again while I was at work.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Mildred grows to teen.png"
      />
      <p>And yet another woman asked me out. I declined yet again.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Duncan rejects a sim at work.png"
      />
      <p>On Thursday, Samantha decided to build a snowman.</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Samantha making a snowman.png"
      />
      <p>And I joined her playing in the snow!</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Duncan and Samantha playing in the snow.png"
      />
      <p>
        While we were outside, Samantha let me know about a butterfly scavenger
        hunt the school was having.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Butterfly scavenger hunt.png"
      />
      <p>
        And that night, both Mimi and Samantha grew into teens – and I was home
        to witness it!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Mimi grows to Teen.png"
      />
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Samantha grows to Teen.png"
      />
      <p>
        Before going back to sleep, Samantha redecorated her room. The toybox
        and toy oven were now gone, replaced with a guitar. The chemistry set
        was still there, though!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/nightmagic/gen1/chapter8/Samantha's room redecorated.png"
      />
      <p>
        As I was playing chess with the apprentices Saturday afternoon, I heard
        Samantha shout, “Yes!” She had been playing with her chemistry set; I
        wonder what she discovered?
      </p>
