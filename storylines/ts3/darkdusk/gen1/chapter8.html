      <h3>February 24, 2013</h3>
      <p>
        Maria climbs up the ladder and sees something new across from Maya’s
        crib – the crib that until today had been hers. The new toy oven is for
        her, and the young Vampire can’t believe it!
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Kelly goes outside, leaving Cyrus to care for Maria and Maya.
        As soon as she steps out the door, she feels the oppressing heat. Even
        in an air-conditioned taxi, the heat is stifling! She asks the taxi
        driver to take her to the fire station, but she’s really headed to the
        park next to the fire station – where she has a gut feeling the Sorenson
        agent is. As the taxi gets closer and closer to the fire station, the
        air gets hotter and hotter, until it feels like Kelly’s skin will burn
        off once she reaches the park. There, she finds the stone that is
        radiating the heat into the air!
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        [Kelly] <em>Now to destroy it!</em><br />
        [???] “So you’ve come.”<br />
        [Kelly] “Who’s there?”
      </p>
      <p>
        A distinctive-looking Human woman steps out from behind the stone. Even
        though Kelly has never seen the woman in person, she knows exactly who
        she is talking to. This is the woman who stole aspirin and laundry
        detergent from the grocery store – the Sorenson agent!
      </p>
      <p>
        [???] “Greetings, Kelly Darkdusk. My name is Cari Geron, and…”<br />
        [Kelly] “And you work for my mother.”<br />
        [Cari] “Yes, but only under duress. The Sorensons have kidnapped my son,
        and I would like to…end…my working relationship with them.”<br />
        [Kelly] “And how do I know this isn’t a trap?”<br />
        [Cari] “We both want Donna Sorenson gone.”<br />
        [Kelly]
        <em
          >I’m still unconvinced, but if I kill Donna and kidnap this woman’s
          son, she’ll be working for me instead of my family!</em
        ><br />
        [Kelly] “Deal.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly returns home and realizes that she’s running low on plasma fruit.
        This calls for one thing – a trip to the grocery store! She quickly robs
        the store. While she’s doing so, Cyrus starts teaching Maya the ways of
        the Vampire.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter8/Cyrus taking Maya's candy.png"
      />
      <p>
        Pretty soon it’s Cyrus’ turn to rob the grocery store, but while he’s on
        the way to the store, Daydream Ivy calls to ask him on a date. He turns
        her down and makes a note to tell Kelly about it. Then he proceeds to
        rob the store – or rather, use his celebrity status to get free plasma
        fruit.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter8/Cyrus turning Daydream down.png"
      />
      <p>
        The next morning, Maria decides she wants something different from the
        usual plasma juice or fruit for breakfast.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Maria]
        <em
          >While Mother’s asleep, I’ll steal this cake from the
          refrigerator!</em
        >
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter8/Maria stealing from the fridge.png"
      />
      <p>
        She doesn’t wake Kelly up; Maya takes care of that for her. But by the
        time Kelly is awake, all of the evidence that Maria had eaten any cake
        is gone! Well, except the fact that there is less cake in the
        refrigerator. Buy Kelly is too busy taking care of Maya to notice what
        Maria has done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noticing that there is a Human school bus waiting for Maria, Cyrus takes
        a bit of time to tell her about school.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cyrus] “Remember, you’re a Darkdusk. You’re superior to everyone else
        in this town. And don’t let the Humans at the school tell you
        otherwise.”<br />
        [Maria] “Got it!”
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter8/Cyrus telling Maria about school.png"
      />
      <p>
        And Maria goes off to her first day of school. [Maria]
        <em>This looks like a lot of fun! I wonder who all these people are…</em
        ><br />
        [???] “Hello class. I’m Mr. Van Gould, and I will be your teacher.”<br />
        [Class] “Hello, Mr. Van Gould.”<br />
        [Maria] <em>He’s a Vampire…just like me.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cyrus gets a call from the science lab. Apparently, some of the
        scientists have been reading the tabloids and have read about the times
        where people had died near The Great Darkness. They offer Cyrus the
        opportunity to test their new Ghost-O-Matic machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cyrus] “Should I take it?”<br />
        [Kelly] “Do it.” <em>This fits perfectly into my plans.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After a performance, Cyrus comes home just in time for Maya’s
        development ceremony! The ceremony goes off without a hitch.
      </p>

        What are Kelly’s plans? Is Cari telling the truth? And what’s going on
        at the school? Find out next time on <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
