      <p>
        Kelly starts to teach Maya the ways of the Vampire. Maya is a quick
        learner.

      <p>
        The next day, Kelly and Cari get ready to cross over to the Realm of
        Night.
      </p>
      <p>[Cari] “It’s time to end the Sorenson threat once and for all!”</p>
      <p>
        And, with Cari’s expertise, they cross over safely. The two land near a
        house in a dark corner of the Realm of Night.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        [Kelly] “We made it…”<br />
        [Cari] “Something’s not right, though. The Realm is deteriorating.”<br />
        [Kelly] “We’ll worry about that later. Let’s find Donna and your son.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As the duo travel closer and closer to the Sorenson mansion, the signs
        of the Realm’s deterioration get worse and worse. Finally they make it
        there, to be greeted by a young Human man.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        [???] “Mother? Is that you?”<br />
        [Cari] “Yes, it’s me. I’ve come to get you out of here.”<br />
        [Cari’s son] “That’s not going to be easy. Once the Sorensons see I’m
        gone…”
      </p>
      <p>
        Before he can finish the sentence, Donna Sorenson comes out to see
        what’s going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Donna] “Kelly Sorenson. How nice of you to return. Please, come in.”<br />
        [Kelly] “I think I will.”
      </p>
      <p>Within seconds, Donna Sorenson is dead.</p>

      />
      <p>
        [Desirae] “Dear sister, thank you so much for aiding me in my ascension.
        Allow me to repay you.”<br />
        [Cari (whispering to Kelly)] “Quick…let’s find him and leave!”<br />
        [Kelly (whispering to Cari)] “Right!”
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter9/A second death.png"
      />
      <p>
        [Cari] “We’re too late. I can sense it…he’s…dead.”<br />
        [Kelly] “We’d better get out of here! Desirae will kill us next!”
      </p>
      <p>
        And they did indeed leave the Sorenson mansion, crossing immediately
        back to the Realm of Dusk.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cari] “I can’t believe she did that…”<br />
        [Kelly] “Desirae is never without a plan. I’ve spent enough time around
        her to know that.”<br />
        [Cari] “I’m more concerned about the state of the Realm of Night. I need
        to do some research on why it’s that way. I might be making a huge
        mistake by asking this of you, but I have no other choice. Could you
        take care of my daughter while I find out what’s going on?”<br />
        [Kelly] “Sure.” <em>Now I have a way to control her…</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is Desirae’s plan? Why is the Realm of Night falling apart? And is
        Cari making a mistake by trusting Kelly? Find out next time on
        <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
