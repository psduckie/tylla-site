      <h3>October 30, 2012</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing the two now-fully-developed Vampires do is marry in a
        private ceremony in their kitchen. Their house isn’t known yet, so there
        is no need for a party.
      </p>

      <p>
        They also start working on Kelly’s plan to influence the people of the
        Realm of Dusk. Kelly becomes a fortune teller, giving readings that
        always benefit the Darkdusk house. For his part, Cyrus uses his Vampiric
        athletic skills to become “The Great Darkness,” an acrobat that will
        take the stage by storm, bringing in much-needed Simoleons while also
        making the Darkdusk name more known. The plan is in motion. However,
        Cyrus has his first (well, his first as a fully-developed Vampire)
        encounter with the Realm of Dusk’s sun, which he finds to be quite
        painful to Vampiric skin. He makes a note that future Darkdusks will
        need to do something about that once they take over the Realm.

      <p>As soon as he gets home, he starts practicing.</p>
      <p>
        That night, something interrupts Kelly’s rest. It’s a phone call, but
        not any ordinary phone call: one from the Realm of Night! It’s Donna
        Sorenson!
      </p>

      <p>
        [Kelly] “Mother?”<br />
        [Donna] “I know you call yourself Kelly Darkdusk now, but you’re still
        Kelly Sorenson to me. As long as you know your place, you’ll be
        fine.”<br />
        [Kelly] “I’m the leader of my own house now. We can be friends or not;
        it’s your choice.”<br />
        [Donna] “As long as you stay in your own Realm, we can be friends, Kelly
        Sorenson.” <em>click</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Kelly and Cyrus go to the school one last time, this time
        for their graduation ceremony. Both of them graduate with honors, as
        they expected. Kelly is voted Most Likely to Take Over the Realm, and
        Cyrus is voted Most Likely to Save the Realm.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        This worries Kelly. Her own husband, who is just as evil as she is,
        could save the Realm from her? To what end?
      </p>

        The Great Darkness’ first performance is a success, and Cyrus Darkdusk
        becomes a minor celebrity. Still, he thinks the performance could have
        gone better. Cyrus continues to put on performances and bring in
        Simoleons for the Darkdusk house. Kelly, on the other hand, isn’t doing
        as well with her fortune-telling.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night, Kelly discovers a Fairy that had been run over by a car in a
        parking lot. Being the heartless and evil Vampire that she is, she turns
        and walks away.

      />
      <p>
        Knowing that plasma fruit would be a better plasma substitute than
        plasma juice until the Darkdusks got some minions to drink from, Kelly
        purchases a gardening book from Cyrus’ old bookstore after walking away
        from the distressed Fairy. This book takes longer to read than the
        alchemy book did, and it has nothing about plasma fruit in it! What a
        waste!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter3/Kelly skilling gardening.png"
      />
      <p>
        After finishing the book, Kelly decides to try her luck anyway. The only
        question is, where to find plasma fruit seeds? She goes to the grocery
        store to look for the seeds and finds actual plasma fruit!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cashier] “You have to pay for those!”<br />
        [Kelly] “No, I don’t.” <em>shows teeth</em><br />
        [Cashier] “Okay, okay! I get your point!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily for Kelly, the grocery store doesn’t call the police. After the
        robbery, Kelly tells Cyrus about the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        What will Cyrus do about the robbery? Will Kelly be able to plant the
        plasma fruit? And what is Donna up to? Find out next time on
        <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
