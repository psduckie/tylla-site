      <p>
        As Kelly and Cyrus sleep later that night, Donna’s mixture permeates the
        air of the Realm of Dusk, altering the memories and desires of the
        inhabitants. Luckily for the Darkdusks, they seem to be mostly
        unaffected, as do people’s memories of them.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        After she wakes up, Kelly works on upgrading the toilet. She doesn’t
        finish before Cyrus wakes up, grabs a bite to eat, and gets the mail. In
        the mail, he finds membership certificates from the local gym. He goes
        to hang them, along with his diploma and school award, up on the wall,
        but the Lord of Dusk intervenes.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <em><strong>You Shall Not Hang Those On The Wall!</strong></em>
      </h4>
      <p>Cyrus: “Okay…maybe that wasn’t such a good idea.”</p>
      <p>Kelly and Cyrus then decide to try for an heir.</p>
      <p>
        At work, Daydream Ivy is now Kelly’s boss at the Duskwood
        Fortune-Telling Agency, thanks to Donna’s mixture. Kelly does get some
        new clients, though: Ronnie Gates and Bailey Swain. For his part, Cyrus
        looks at his schedule and notices that he has one more performance than
        he remembers having. Of course, he does marvelously.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Kelly gets home from work, she sits down and reads. However, she
        doesn’t feel well, and soon leaves the book to get sick. Could it be?
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter5/Kelly getting sick.png"
      />
      <p>
        Kelly waters the garden, awaiting the bump that she hopes will come.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter5/Watering the plants.png"
      />
      <p>And…</p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter5/Baby bump Kelly.png"
      />
      <h4>It comes!</h4>
      <p>
        Kelly invites Daydream and Bailey over for a party to celebrate. (She
        invites Ronnie, also, but he can’t make it.) Bailey even brings lobster!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter5/Guitar party.png"
      />
      <p>
        Daydream starts playing guitar and everyone but Cyrus (who’s smart
        enough to stay out of the Realm of Dusk sun) comes outside and listens.
        Now that she knows why Kelly wasn’t at work that day, Daydream gives
        Kelly her pay and puts her on a week paid leave, which Kelly happily
        accepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the pregnancy, Cyrus tries to make Kelly feel comfortable. He
        does all the heavy work, leaving Kelly to relax. They both hope for a
        healthy daughter to carry on the Darkdusk legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the risk, Cyrus does make a grocery run; he knows that Kelly
        prefers plasma fruit to juice. A policeman is standing in front of the
        store.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Policeman] “Sorry, we can’t let you in. This store is closed right
        now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cyrus ignores the policeman and runs in anyway. The store has already
        been burglarized – but by someone other than Kelly! Kelly only steals
        plasma fruit; this burglar stole aspirin and laundry detergent while
        leaving the plasma fruit alone. Cyrus runs to the produce section,
        steals some plasma fruits, and runs out of the store in less than thirty
        seconds. In five minutes, he loses the police, and in ten, he is back to
        Kelly.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Kelly goes out (in the sun again! Won’t she ever learn?) and
        harvests her garden. Cyrus doesn’t have the skill to do this. It turns
        out to be the first and only harvest that she will ever get from these
        plants, as the full moon returns, and with it, the Zombies. This time,
        they eat her plants, leaving nothing but dead husks.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        The Zombies don’t make it inside the Darkdusk house, and baby Maria is
        born the next day.

        Meanwhile, in the Realm of Night… [Desirae] “It didn’t work! I don’t
        understand why it didn’t work! I mixed everything perfectly and it still
        didn’t work! Unless…”

        Will baby Maria grow up well? Will Kelly replant her lost garden? And
        who stole the aspirin and laundry detergent from the grocery store? Find
        out next time on <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
