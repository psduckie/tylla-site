      <h3>October 28, 2012</h3>

      <p>
        Kelly finds a suitable building to start their house…that is, suitable
        once Cyrus finishes some remodeling work. All of the windows are removed
        and destroyed, and a second floor is added above the bedroom. The final
        result:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/The Darkdusk House.jpg"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the remodeling takes up most of the stolen money, and
        both Darkdusks have to get part-time jobs. Kelly despises this fact,
        thinking herself above working as a receptionist, but recognizes that
        the Darkdusk house will fall before it gets a chance to rise if she does
        not do this. Cyrus, on the other hand, had always been treated as a
        second-class citizen in the Realm of Night, and as such is used to
        working low-paying jobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        After getting their jobs, Kelly and Cyrus go to the gym. Kelly works
        out, and Cyrus practices his speech in the mirror. Although Kelly’s
        Vampire nature has not developed fully, it has developed to the point
        where she and Cyrus can tone their bodies and practice their speech
        faster than Humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two aspiring nobles also have to go to school with the Humans.
        Again, Kelly is upset.
      </p>

      <p>
        [Kelly] “Why do I, a noble heiress, have to go to the same school as
        these…”
      </p>

      <p>
        [Cyrus] “It’s the perfect cover while we develop our house.”<br />
        [Kelly] “I suppose you have a point there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After coming home from work, Kelly and Cyrus know they should work on
        their homework to build said cover, but they are just too tired. Even a
        Vampire has to sleep, after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Cyrus sleeping.png" />
      </p>

      <p>When they wake up, however…</p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Kelly and Cyrus doing HW.png"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing his homework, Cyrus decides to test out his Vampiric
        body. After all, if the house comes under attack, it is his job to
        protect Kelly and any daughters they might have.
      </p>

        <img
          src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Cyrus exercising.png"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        After all that, the two Darkdusks are able to watch some TV before
        school.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Kelly and Cyrus watching Human TV.png"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        [Cyrus] “The TV in this Realm is terrible; it’s actually funny how bad
        it is!”<br />
        [Kelly] “Yeah. Doesn’t anyone own any good entertainers?”
      </p>

      <p>As Cyrus is about to respond, the bus comes.</p>

      <p>[Kelly and Cyrus] “Remember, look normal.”</p>

      <p>
        Kelly and Cyrus are actually amazed by what they learned in school:
        slavery, an accepted institution in the Realm of Night, is illegal in
        the Realm of Dusk and had been for decades. Even the people they had
        seen on TV earlier that day are free and working for money!
      </p>

      <p>
        On the way home, Kelly decides to try her mind-controlling powers on the
        Human bus driver. She figures that she needs to hone those skills, but
        he just drops the busload of students off at a random spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img
          src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/This isn't home!.png"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Kelly does get some amusement, however, as a Werewolf runaway from her
        home Realm chases a young Human woman with skin pale enough that she
        could be mistaken for a Vampire down the sidewalk.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Werewolf chase.png" />
      </p>

      <p>
        That amusement is lost when Kelly gets home and does something she’s
        never done before: taking out the trash. She finds this extremely
        aggravating. Why does she have to do it?
      </p>

      <p><img src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Trash!.png" /></p>

      <p>
        Because she doesn’t have anyone to do it for her, that’s why! Cyrus is
        off at work, and the house is starting to smell. This is a serious
        reality check for Kelly; building a house is a lot harder than it seemed
        back in the Realm of Night.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few days later, Kelly experiences another first: a Realm of Dusk full
        moon. She knew from her history class back in the Realm of Night that
        the Realm of Dusk had been the site of a battle between the Vampires and
        the Fairies, and that weapons from that battle are still rumored to
        exist. Well, they exist. Kelly just saw them, and though the Zombies
        were created to attack Fairies, these Zombies seem content to feast on
        Vampire brains!
      </p>

      <p><img src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter1/Zombies!.png" /></p>

      <p>
        [Kelly] “Got to get to the car…”<br />
        [Zombie] “Brains…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Will Kelly live through this Zombie attack? And what about Cyrus? Is he
        safe? Find out next time on <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
