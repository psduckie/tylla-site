        Kelly and Cyrus get away from the Zombies, and make it home safely.
        However, with all the chaos of the Zombie attack, they forget to do
        their homework! Luckily, they have established themselves as such good
        “students” that that didn’t matter for Cyrus. Kelly, on the other hand,
        is the victim of an accusation of academic dishonesty. The accusation is
        false, of course; it is simply a racist student trying to attack the new
        Vampire in class. That said, Kelly does have to sit through an
        after-school lecture on why cheating is wrong while the school staff
        sort through the mess. This lecture makes her late for work, and her
        boss is not pleased.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Boss] “You’re late! I hope you have a good excuse.”<br />
        [Kelly] “As a matter of fact, I do. It’s called, ‘I quit.’”<br />
        [Boss] “Fine. Just please finish this shift.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Cyrus is up to something at his job as well. Kelly has always
        complained about how they can’t afford an alchemy table, and Cyrus knows
        that the bookstore has just gotten some books on alchemy in stock. Using
        the money he earns that day – money the house desperately needs – he
        buys the book. Since he is an employee, they even throw in free gift
        wrapping.
      </p>
      <p>[Cyrus] “I can’t wait to see the look on Kelly’s face!”</p>
      <img

      />
      <p>[Kelly] “I love it!”</p>
      <p>
        The next day is the last day of school. Kelly and Cyrus go and say
        goodbye to their classmates; their development as Vampires is almost
        complete. All that is required now is to ritually complete the
        development. As Kelly and Cyrus walk to the refrigerator, Kelly explains
        the ritual to Cyrus.

      <p>
        [Kelly] “This cake is made from the Plasma fruit. When you eat it, you
        become a full-fledged Vampire!”<br />
        [Cyrus] “Aren’t I a Vampire now?”<br />
        [Kelly] “You are, but your Vampiric powers are still developing. The
        Plasma fruit is needed to finish the development.”
      </p>
      <p>Cyrus eats the cake and…</p>

      />
      <p>
        However, the cake doesn’t have any effect on Kelly, as its ritual power
        is expended after completing the development of one Vampire, and Cyrus’
        Vampirism had developed faster than Kelly had anticipated. Cyrus quits
        his job at the bookstore, thinking that, as a fully developed Vampire,
        he can get a better-paying adult job.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Kelly tries the ritual again with another cake. This time,
        it works.

        Now that Kelly and Cyrus are fully developed, how will they lead their
        lives? Or un-lives, as the case may be. Find out next time on
