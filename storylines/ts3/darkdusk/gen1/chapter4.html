      <h3>November 3, 2012</h3>
      <p>
        Kelly realizes that she has no clue what a plasma fruit plant needs to
        grow – and that the grocery store has more plasma fruit, ripe for the
        taking. With those realizations, she doesn’t plant the plasma fruit –
        she eats one of them.
      </p>
      <p>[Kelly] “Delicious!”</p>
      <p>
        Cyrus resolves to rob the grocery store himself, but since The Great
        Darkness has a performance that night, the robbery will have to wait. He
        satisfies himself with a pack of plasma juice.
      </p>

      <p>
        While The Great Darkness is performing, Kelly goes to the local potion
        shop. There, she finds a book full of potion recipes. She starts
        reading…
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter4/Kelly reading massive alchemy book.png"
      />
      <p>
        …and keeps reading until the night is almost over. Meanwhile, The Great
        Darkness gets the opportunity he had been hoping for – a weekly
        performance gig!
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly also has some good news at work. The Duskwood Fortune-Telling
        Agency, having not discovered that she had been making actual readings
        the whole time instead of reading fortunes from the newspaper like she
        was supposed to, promotes her! Now she’s allowed to make actual
        readings, so if she gets caught doing that, she can just claim she’s
        doing her job – because she is doing her job!
      </p>
      <p>
        After coming home from work, Kelly and Cyrus celebrate. After the
        celebration, Cyrus decides to go get some food. As Cyrus leaves to rob
        the grocery store, Kelly finishes up her night and gets some sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cashier] “Oh no, another vamp…oh, it’s you, The Great Darkness! Please,
        go right through!”
      </p>
      <p>[Cyrus] “That was easy!”</p>
      <img

      <p>
        After using his celebrity status to get free food, The Great Darkness
        decides to do an impromptu performance at the park. It’s a hit!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter4/Kelly catching bugs.png"
      />
      <p>
        Kelly, having heard that the local science lab is paying for insects,
        decides to catch a few. After she finishes selling them, she notices
        she’s low on food…time to go grocery “shopping!”
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cashier] “Not you again!”<br />
        [Kelly] “Yes, it’s me. Now give me the plasma fruit and no one gets
        bitten.” <em>shows teeth</em><br />
        [Cashier] “Fine, fine! Take the fruit!”
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>Kelly and Cyrus embrace before they go to sleep.</p>
      <div class="darkdusk_night">
        Meanwhile, in the Realm of Night… [Donna] “I trust our plan to deal with
        the upstart is going along smoothly?” [Desirae] “Yes. When we send this
        alchemical mixture through the Barrier, Kelly Sorenson will be dead
        within a week.” [Donna] “Excellent…”
      </div>
      <p>
        Back in the Realm of Dusk, Kelly braves the sun to plant some alchemical
        ingredients, fertilizing them with some of her plasma fruits.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter4/Kelly planting.png"
      />
      <p>
        The next night, Cyrus goes to the grocery store before the park
        performance he has taken to doing every night.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Cashier] “Hello, The Great Darkness. I love your performances; this
        load of groceries is on me.”<br />
        [Cyrus] “Thanks!”<br />
        [Cashier] “By the way, if you see that other vampire that keeps robbing
        us, please tell her to stop.”<br />
        [Cyrus] “I’ll keep an eye out for her.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Cyrus says nothing about telling Kelly to stop robbing the store. He
        also says nothing about Kelly being his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning, cleaning was something Kelly hated to do. Now, she
        knows a way to make parts of the house clean themselves! She starts with
        the shower, because that’s the most annoying thing to clean; her plan is
        to then move on to the toilet, sinks and stove, in that order. Luckily
        for Cyrus, she finishes the shower upgrade just as he comes home needing
        to use the shower! Because she doesn’t want to upgrade the toilet while
        Cyrus is in the shower (she needs to keep up some Realm of Dusk
        standards of decency), she goes for the kitchen sink.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        As Kelly sleeps that morning, Cyrus tries to do the laundry and breaks
        the washer. He’s too tired to fix it, however, and the broken thing
        leaks dirty water all over the floor. When he gets up, he sees the flood
        and fixes the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        At work, Kelly meets a new client at the Duskwood Fortune-Telling
        Agency. Daydream Ivy asks to have her fortune told; Kelly, of course,
        gives one that benefits herself and Cyrus. Daydream is satisfied and
        tells Kelly that they should talk again. Kelly, thinking that the
        Darkdusks should know some of the natives, agrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly comes home to Cyrus still dealing with the mess on the floor. She
        uses the opportunity to rob the grocery store.
      </p>
      <p>
        [911] “911, what’s your emergency?”<br />
        [Manager] “Hello, this is Mike’s grocery store. We’re being robbed!”<br />
        [911] “All right, we’ll send police over.”
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time the police make it to the grocery store, Kelly is long gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later that night, Kelly and Cyrus attend a party that one of Cyrus’ fans
        is throwing. The two Darkdusks mingle with the locals and then begin to
        dance.
      </p>

      <div class="darkdusk_night">
        As Kelly and Cyrus dance in the Realm of Dusk, Desirae walks up to the
        Barrier separating her Realm of Night from the Realm of Dusk. She has
        the alchemical mixture in hand. [Desirae] “This should destroy my pesky
        younger sister once and for all!” Desirae throws the mixture at the
        Barrier, and the vial that contains it shatters as it passes through to
        the Realm of Dusk. The older Sorenson sister laughs evilly.

      <p>
        What exactly will the mixture do? Will Kelly and Cyrus be able to
        survive? And who’s the greater threat: Donna or Desirae? Find out next
        time on <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
