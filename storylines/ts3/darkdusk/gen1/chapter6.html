        While Kelly takes care of Maria and replants one of her plants, Cyrus
        performs as The Great Darkness. After all, there is now one more
        Darkdusk, and the house needs the money more than ever. After the
        performance is done and Cyrus returns home, Kelly returns to the grocery
        store, which is still closed while the police are investigating the
        burglary and theft of the aspirin and laundry detergent. Kelly decides
        to do some investigation of her own, just to make sure the police aren’t
        investigating her or Cyrus’ robberies.
      </p>
      <p>What she finds, though, is much worse.</p>
      <p>
        The aspirin and laundry detergent are indeed gone, and the police are
        focusing on that section of the store. What the police don’t realize is
        that the real clue to discovering who did it is under the plasma fruit
        display – which Kelly is naturally drawn to. She notices a card hidden
        under the display. Upon picking up the card, she notices a distinctive
        symbol that makes her non-beating heart sink.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s the Sorenson house insignia. Donna or Desirae had created that
        card, and then given it to an agent to place in the grocery store.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly immediately realizes why the store was burglarized in the first
        place. The aspirin and laundry detergent were never part of the reason;
        the Sorenson agent merely picked those items because they were far away
        from the produce section (and would probably sell well in the Realm of
        Night!). The real reason was to draw police attention, and to get the
        police to close the store for investigation! What the Sorensons didn’t
        count on was that Kelly’s and Cyrus’ Vampiric speed gets them past the
        police and into the store, making it even easier than normal to steal
        plasma fruit!
      </p>

        While Kelly is stealing plasma fruit from the grocery store – right
        under the police’s nose – it’s Cyrus’ turn to take care of Maria. Once
        Kelly comes home, the two work on a new addition to the house: a room
        for Maria and any other children the Darkdusks may have. After all, a
        Vampire house with only one daughter doesn’t live long. The addition is
        finished just as Maria grows to be a toddler.

        Kelly invites Daydream and Bailey, along with their friend Alice
        Fitzgerald, to Maria’s birthday party. Daydream brings food (which, of
        course, is of no nutritional value whatsoever to Kelly and Cyrus), which
        Kelly graciously accepts, to the party.

        Meanwhile, in the Realm of Night… [Donna] “The report on my wayward
        daughter?” [???] “Despite the mixture’s effects, the upstarts still
        live.” [Donna] “This will not stand!” [Desirae] “Why don’t we just kill
        her now?” [Donna] “She still may be useful. Place this stone in the
        Realm of Dusk.” [???] “Yes, my lady.”

        As Kelly and Maria sleep, Cyrus steals plasma fruit from the grocery
        store. The police presence at the door is gone, but the store is still
        closed.

        After stealing from the grocery store, Cyrus goes to a party at Faith
        MacDuff’s mansion. He has no intention of actually attending the party;
        he instead intends to steal from the mansion! With the aid of his
        Vampiric strength, he steals a mirror, a water fountain, and a
        loveseat(!), putting the items into a “stolen” car (which is actually
        not stolen, but Cyrus’ own car that he bought without Kelly’s knowledge)
        before speeding off.

        Who is the mysterious Sorenson agent? What is Donna’s latest plan? And
        how will it affect Kelly and Cyrus – and the rest of the
