        town.

      <p>
        The Realm of Night is a dark place, ruled by Vampire noble houses. One
        of the strongest of those houses is the Sorenson house.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/prologue/Sorensons at TV.jpg" />
      <p>
        From left to right in the picture, the Sorenson nobles are: Donna
        Sorenson, the leader of the house; Desirae Sorenson, Donna’s elder
        daughter and second-in-command; Kelly Sorenson, Donna’s younger
        daughter; and Roberto Sorenson, Desirae’s and Kelly’s father. Roberto
        holds only a tenuous claim to nobility, as he is related to Donna not by
        blood, but by marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, the eldest daughter takes over leadership of the house
        upon the death of the old leader. This tradition has created an enmity
        between Desirae and Kelly over the years. When Donna tells Kelly that
        she will have to fully develop as a Vampire before she can have a
        position in the Sorenson organization, it pushes Kelly to the breaking
        point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kelly, though, is not the type to simply lash out at her superiors,
        which is what the other Sorenson nobles (with the possible exception of
        Roberto, but Kelly did not want to risk angering her mother by attacking
        him) are at this point. Instead, she takes a notebook and pencil
        identical to the ones she uses to aid in her development and writes
        something else – the foundations for a master plan of her own. As far as
        Kelly is concerned, she doesn’t need the Sorensons. The Barriers between
        the Realms are broken; the Realm of Dusk is ripe for conquest. All she
        needs now is the appropriate mate and the appropriate opportunity.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Kelly finds that mate in Cyrus Best, a Human immigrant from the Realm of
        Dusk that has as much of a capability for evil as she does. Ideally, he
        would be a Vampire like her, but a quick bite fixes that problem. The
        opportunity comes at daybreak, as the underage Vampires have not yet
        developed an aversion to sunlight. They steal §18,500 from the
        Sorensons, make a break for the Barrier separating the Realm of Night
        from the Realm of Dusk and soon, they are on their way. No longer Kelly
        Sorenson and Cyrus Best, they are now Kelly and Cyrus Darkdusk, founding
        a new house to conquer the Realm of Dusk!
      </p>
      <p>The challenge starts now.</p>
