      <h3>December 8, 2012</h3>
      <p>
        Later that night, Cyrus and Maria have a bit of fun playing together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next night, Kelly isn’t feeling all that well as she cleans up the
        dirty dishes from Maria’s birthday party. Maybe she ate a bad plasma
        fruit? On top of that, the sink is broken! Kelly fixes the sink and
        finishes cleaning up the dishes, only to find the toilet broken. She is
        not having a good night!
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter7/Toilet does NOT want to get fixed!.png"
      />
      <p>
        As Cyrus goes to the park to perform, Kelly tries unsuccessfully to fix
        the toilet. She is still feeling sick, and reminds herself to check for
        bad plasma fruit next time she robs the grocery store. Finally, a sound
        from upstairs takes Kelly’s attention away from the toilet. It’s Maria,
        who had been sleeping and is now awake.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter7/Teaching Maria to talk.png"
      />
      <p>
        Kelly can’t understand what Maria is saying, and so teaches the young
        Vampire how to talk.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter7/Pregnant Kelly...again.png"
      />
      <p>
        Later that night, Kelly learns why she was feeling sick earlier. She’s
        pregnant again; Maria is going to have a younger sibling. Both Kelly and
        Cyrus hope for another daughter. Maria is too young to know the
        consequences of either gender; if she were old enough to know, she would
        probably have hoped for a son.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter7/Kelly at TV.png"
      />
      <p>
        The next day, Kelly sits down at the TV, and she is amazed by what she
        sees.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Host] “And we’re back at the 48th Annual Realm of Dusk Entertainment
        Awards!”<br />
        [Co-Host] “That’s right. And now, the award for Best Acrobat goes
        to…”<br />
        [Host] “The Great Darkness!!!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly, unsure about what she just saw, turns off the TV. She knew Cyrus
        was good, but the best in the Realm?
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        Meanwhile, at the park, an elderly woman is enjoying Cyrus’ performance.
        It is the last performance she will ever enjoy; she dies happily of old
        age.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter7/Maria plays with Cosmo.png"
      />
      <p>
        As Cyrus mourns the old woman’s death, Maria plays with a new toy, a
        doll named Cosmo. Kelly wonders where the doll came from; she didn’t buy
        it. Maybe Cyrus did?
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, Kelly feels the familiar pains that signal the coming
        of the baby. Unwilling to give birth in the house this time, she and
        Cyrus rush to the hospital, hiring a babysitter to take care of Maria.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/darkdusk/gen1/chapter7/Kelly and baby Maya.png"
      />
      <p>
        Kelly and Cyrus come home several hours later with baby Maya. However,
        Maya isn’t the only Darkdusk child having a birthday that day; it’s also
        Maria’s birthday! Maya’s birth leaves no time for a party; the Darkdusks
        simply perform the ritual and Maria grows into a child Vampire.
      </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, at the border with the Realm of Night…</p>
      <p>[???] “Once I place this stone, the Vampires will be no more.”</p>
      <p>
        The agent digs a small hole in the ground, and places the stone into the
        hole. As the stone settles in, the sun’s rays grow stronger…
      </p>
      <p>
        Will the Darkdusks survive this new assault? Will they finally find out
        the identity of the agent? And how will Maria and baby Maya grow up in
        this changed world? Find out next time on <em>Realm of Dusk</em>!
