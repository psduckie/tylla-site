      <h3>January 1, 867 - Dunasead, Desmond</h3>
      <p>
        The next thing he knew, Damien was in the year 867 in the southwest of
        what, in his time, was Ireland. But he didn’t know what the political
        situation was in 867; he hadn’t paid much attention in history class at
        school. He looked at the nearby castle, wishing that it would be his.
        The castle drawbridge lowered, and a beautiful young woman walked
        across.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have been waiting for you, my Earl. My name is Aliisza. Come inside
        and I’ll explain things.” Damien followed Aliisza into the castle. She
        told him that his coming was foretold by the Devil and that she was to
        help him. And with that, Damien del Diablo’s quest for evil began…
      </p>
      <p>
        Damien’s first task was to banish the Catholic landholders from his
        realm.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter1/Two banishments.png" />
      <p>
        He gave the bishopric to the one person that shared his goals – Aliisza
        – and kept the city for himself. He also named Aliisza his spymaster;
        she was the only council member that was serving willingly. The others
        were Catholics forced to serve under threat of death.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Damien sent his chancellor to fabricate a claim on the neighboring
        county of Ormond. According to the chancellor, he could attack
        immediately if he wanted, but then he would have the entire island
        attacking him. This was not what Damien wanted.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter1/Claim on Ormond.png" />
      <p>
        Damien had the rest of his council focus on the interior of his domain:
        his marshal trained his troops, his steward collected taxes, and Aliisza
        tried to find any plots against her liege.
      </p>
      <h3>January 3, 868</h3>
      <p>
        One of Damien’s subjects told him that he would be a better spymaster
        than Aliisza.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter1/Better spymaster.png" />
      <p>
        Damien needed a court chaplain, and he thought Aliisza would be perfect
        for that job. So, knowing that it would make Aliisza upset, he granted
        the man’s request. However, when Damien asked Aliisza to remain on the
        council as court chaplain, she refused! He gave her the title of High
        Almoner, hoping that she would change her mind. But she didn’t.
      </p>
      <h3>July 12, 868</h3>
      <p>
        This was a bad day for the forces of evil. Their leader, Damien del
        Diablo, lost one of the Seven Deadly Sins.
      </p>

      <h3>August 3, 868</h3>
      <p>
        Upset with his chancellor’s lack of progress in claiming Ormond for the
        Abyssal forces, Damien decided to invade his other neighbor to the
        north, the county of Thomond – and anyone who tried to stop him would
        receive their eternal reward in the fires of Hell.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter1/The Invasion of Thomond.png"
      />
      <p>
        Damien immediately “borrowed” 300 gold from Jewish moneylenders, and
        then banished them for failing to show proper respect to the Devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure enough, when the Abyssal troops moved into Thomond, the neighboring
        counties raised their own levies. Damien used the gold he had “borrowed”
        to hire mercenaries that either did not know or did not care that they
        were doing the Devil’s bidding, and sent them to the front lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Damien was sieging Thomond, the Catholic forces had decided to cut
        the head off the Abyssal snake by sieging Damien’s own castle! Damien
        couldn’t abandon the siege of Thomond, and right before the castle fell,
        Aliisza had a son, who she named after her liege.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, Aliisza and her newborn son were able to escape the fallen
        castle, and Abyssal forces quickly moved to retake it. The Abyssal and
        Catholic armies clashed outside the walls of Damien’s castle, and as the
        Abyssal forces celebrated their victory, Damien got news from Ormond.
        His chancellor finally had that claim he was supposed to get two years
        earlier! Damien made a mental note to punish the chancellor for his
        tardiness.

        With the victory in Thomond, will Damien be able to keep taking land?
