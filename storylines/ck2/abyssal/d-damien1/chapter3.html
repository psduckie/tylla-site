      <h3>May 22, 872</h3>
      <p>
        One of the Abyssal priests decided he would help himself to some of the
        King’s money. Unfortunately for the priest, he got caught.

      <h3>November 10, 872</h3>
      <p>
        Aliisza had been ill for the past few months, and on this day the
        illness took her to her eternal reward in Hell. King Damien was
        devastated. The woman that had been by his side for more than five years
        – the woman that was the mother of his children – was dead.
      </p>
      <h3>Night of November 16, 872</h3>
      <p>
        As Damien slept, he was contacted in his dreams by the Devil. “I
        understand that Aliisza has returned to me. I will be sending a new
        demoness in her place. Expect her tomorrow.”
      </p>
      <h3>November 17, 872</h3>
      <p>
        Damien was taking care of various kingly duties when a servant told him
        that a young woman was at the gates asking to see him. Remembering what
        had happened the previous night, he immediately rushed to the gates to
        find that she was almost as beautiful as Aliisza. “My name is Sláíne,
        and it is an honor to serve you, my king.”
      </p>
      <h3>January 3, 873</h3>
      <p>
        Damien’s council had been incomplete for two months. On this day, the
        King finally put an end to that, appointing new councilors to replace
        those that had died.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/The new council.png" />
      <p>
        Damien immediately set his Court Chaplain to rooting out the remaining
        Catholics in his realm.
      </p>
      <h3>July 22, 873</h3>
      <p>
        On this day, Sláíne announced to her king that she was pregnant with his
        child.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Slaine is pregnant.png" />
      <h3>July 26, 873</h3>
      <p>
        Damien’s Chancellor, a Catholic that had been forced to serve,
        approached Sláíne and attempted to convert her to Catholicism. Normally
        this act would have earned him a slow, painful death, but he was more
        useful to Damien alive. Sláíne, of course, let her king know what was
        going on, and Damien gave his Chancellor two choices. Either he could
        convert to the Abyssal faith immediately or Damien and Sláíne would
        torture him to death. He chose to convert.
      </p>

      <h3>December 17, 873</h3>
      <p>
        One of Damien’s courtiers envied him and wanted to either become part of
        the council or hold Thomond if it was ever retaken. Damien told the
        courtier that he might think about it.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Envy of Damien.png" />
      <h3>February 23, 874</h3>
      <p>Sláíne gave birth to a son, whom she named Donncuan.</p>
      <h3>October 14, 874</h3>
      <p>
        While Abyssal Bishops had a lot of freedoms, kidnapping the King’s
        daughter was not one of them. For this crime, the King’s Court Chaplain
        lost his head.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <h3>April 8, 876</h3>
      <p>
        Damien walked into Sláíne’s private chambers, seething with rage. “Why
        did YOU start a plot to kill MY heir?” Sláíne replied that she thought
        Donncuan would be a better heir, which only made Damien angrier. “You
        may have been sent by the Devil himself, but you do NOT decide the
        affairs of MY kingdom! SLÁÍNE, YOU ARE FIRED!!!” With that, Damien drew
        his sword and drove it directly through Sláíne, leaving her dead.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Slaine is fired.png" />
      <h3>Night of April 10, 876</h3>
      <p>
        Once again, Damien was contacted in his dreams by the Devil. “You did
        well in destroying Sláíne. She may have been one of my demonesses, but
        you are my Chosen. Remember that. I will send one more, but now that you
        have Abyssal women, this will be the last.”
      </p>
      <h3>April 11, 876</h3>
      <p>
        Once again, a beautiful woman appeared at the gates. This time her name
        was Áine. Damien knew exactly what to do.
      </p>
      <h3>September 3, 876</h3>
      <p>
        Damien started to instruct his son and heir in the ways of the Abyssal
        on this day.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <h3>October 14, 876</h3>
      <p>
        Damien Jr.’s instruction was going well, as he picked up one of the
        Seven Deadly Sins.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Damien Jr. becomes Proud.png"
      />
      <h3>February 13, 877</h3>
      <p>
        King Damien would be a father yet again, as Áine was pregnant with his
        child.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Aine is pregnant.png" />
      <h3>June 27, 877</h3>
      <p>
        Damien ordered that the first ever Abyssal Summer Fair be held in
        Desmond as a way to spread the Abyssal faith.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/The Summer Fair starts.png" />
      <h3>During the Abyssal Summer Fair</h3>
      <p>
        An Abyssal priest preached about how the so-called “sins” of the
        Catholic Church were really virtues, and how at the end of the world,
        faithful Abyssal would receive their eternal reward in Hell.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Abyssal priest at the Summer Fair.png"
      />
      <h3>After the Abyssal Summer Fair</h3>
      <p>
        While shutting down an illegal Catholic sermon, one of Damien’s Abyssal
        enforcers overheard one of the Catholics talking about how “all animals
        were God’s creatures.” After the King heard this, he decided to kill
        some, simply to spite the Catholics.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/The Grand Hunt starts.png" />
      <p>
        While King Damien and the hunting party were away, Áine gave birth to a
        baby boy.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Murchad is born.png" />
      <h3>During the Grand Hunt</h3>
      <p>
        Damien and his hunting party managed to kill an entire drove of hares.
        Not wanting the meat to go to waste, he took it back to prepare for
        stew.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter3/Damien kills hares.png" />
      <p>The Grand Hunt was now over. What would happen to Damien next?</p>
