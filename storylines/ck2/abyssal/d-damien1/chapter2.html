      <h2 class="display-4">Chapter 2 - The Reign of King Damien I</h2>
      <h3>November 9, 869</h3>
      <p>
        With Thomond safely in Abyssal hands, Damien decided that he should no
        longer be referred to as “Earl.” Instead, he should be known as “King!”
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter2/A king is made.png" />
      <p>
        The newly-crowned King granted Thomond’s bishopric to one of his loyal
        followers, and made that man his Court Chaplain, a position that had
        until that time been vacant.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter2/A new Court Chaplain.png" />
      <p>
        Damien immediately set his new Chaplain to the task of converting his
        lands to the Abyssal ways, and set his own sights on the neighboring
        provinces. He would stop at nothing to claim them as his own, and his
        royal decree that the Abyssal Church would provide him with as many
        forces as it could showed that!
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of his “stop-at-nothing” strategy, Damien hired mercenaries that
        he could not afford for an attack on Ormond.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Needless to say, the attack failed when Damien ran out of gold and the
        mercenaries left. Worse, while Damien was on the battlefield, two
        disturbing things happened. First, he received a foreboding message…
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter2/A foreboding message.png" />
      <p>
        And second, he took an arrow not in the knee, but just below. According
        to some of the more seasoned combatants, if the arrow had hit just a bit
        higher, Damien would have never been able to fight again. As it was, it
        would leave a scar, but it would heal.
      </p>

          joke, even though Skyrim didn’t exist in 2006!)</em

      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Surprisingly, Ormond accepted a white peace, even though they had
        clearly won the war. But Damien swore that he would one day rule that
        land.
      </p>

      <h3>December 29, 870</h3>
      <p>
        The Spymaster that had been appointed back in 868 had since been fired
        for poor performance, and Aliisza had been given the job back. Once
        again, he claimed to Damien that he would make a better Spymaster than
        Aliisza. This time, Damien told him that he was still fired, and that if
        he asked again, he would get a free trip to the dungeons. As the man
        left, Damien wondered if he had done the right thing in giving him a
        second chance. Aliisza told Damien that if the man had indeed learned
        his lesson, then the answer was yes.
      </p>
      <h3>May 5, 871</h3>
      <p>
        Two people got married in the Catholic tradition. This was highly
        illegal in the Abyssal realm. To make matters worse, one of them was
        Damien’s Chancellor! Damien ordered both newlyweds captured and
        imprisoned, but using the Chancellor’s knowledge of Damien’s own escape
        routes, they escaped from the Abyssal realm.
      </p>

      />
      <h3>June 9, 871</h3>
      <p>
        Aliisza was once again pregnant. Damien took the news the same as he had
        taken the news of her last pregnancy: with sheer enjoyment.
      </p>
      <h3>July 3, 871</h3>
      <p>
        After the marriage debacle, the Chancellor’s position had been empty for
        almost two months. Damien finally announced the replacement Chancellor:
        out of all of the poorly-qualified candidates, Damien picked the least
        poorly-qualified.
      </p>

          raised to 11 after I picked him but before I took the picture.)</em

      <h3>December 7, 871</h3>
      <p>
        Damien had almost forgotten about the message he had received during the
        disastrous war for Ormond. Almost, but not quite. So he was not
        surprised when Lorcán, the man that he had been warned about, declared
        war on him.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/gamepics/abyssal/chapter2/Lorcan attacks.png" />
      <p>
        The question was, who would win? The evil forces of the Abyssal, or the
        righteous Lorcán’s Host?
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t even a question. The war was over within a month. Lorcán’s
        1,800-man-strong force completely overpowered the Abyssal forces, which
        were still weakened from Ormond. Lorcán took Thomond for his own, but
        left Damien his stronghold of Desmond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after the loss of Thomond, Aliisza gave birth to a baby
        daughter, whom she named after herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will Damien recover from these losses and triumph over his newest enemy?
