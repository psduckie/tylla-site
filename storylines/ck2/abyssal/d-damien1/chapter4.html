      <h3>January 15, 878</h3>
      <p>Young Aliisza had grown to the point that she needed a guardian to watch over her. As was befitting an Abyssal princess, Queen Áine became her guardian.</p>

      <h3>February 12, 878</h3>
      <p>Fed up with Damien’s rule, the peasants of Desmond started to take up weapons. Damien sent troops to quell the riot, but he wasn’t sure that he could keep it contained.</p>

      <h3>May 22, 878</h3>
      <p>Still dealing with the peasant riot, Damien started to question his Abyssal values. <em>Maybe it would be best to tell the peasants the truth? No, I’m an Abyssal king. There’s no reason to do that. Or is there…</em></p>

      <h3>May 27. 878</h3>
      <p>Desmond was under attack! Norse raiders, thinking that Damien was a Catholic, landed in Desmond and started stealing whatever they could find. Damien would have none of that: only he had the right to steal from his demesne! The Abyssal soldiers, fresh from putting down the peasant riot, started to chase the Norse out of Desmond.</p>

      <h3>June 16, 878</h3>
      <p>The battle against the Norse was still going on. To add to the mess, a group of Catholic rebels decided to attack Damien’s Court Chaplain!</p>

      <h3>June 22, 878</h3>
      <p>Desmond was finally at peace: the Norse had been driven out, and the rebels put down.</p>

      <h3>October 26, 878</h3>
      <p>As Damien was about to retire to his chambers, a mysterious man gave him a mysterious book. Once he opened the book, Damien immediately knew what it was: a gift from the Devil to aid the Abyssal kingdom!</p>

      <h3>December 16, 878</h3>
      <p>Damien Jr. learned from his father that the entire world rightfully belonged to the Abyssal, and decided to stop at nothing to unite the world under the Abyssal faith.</p>

      <h3>January 17, 879</h3>
      <p>Damien was at his various kingly duties when he noticed that Damien Jr. was missing. After looking throughout the castle for his son, Damien finally found him in one of the towers. Damien told his son that the towers were too dangerous for children and that he could have gotten hurt, to which Damien Jr. replied that he would get hurt anyway spreading the Abyssal faith. Still, Damien’s words had an impact on his son, and Damien Jr. would not climb the tower again.</p>

      <h3>April 29, 879</h3>
      <p>Damien had yet to understand the book he had received from the Devil’s messenger the previous October. But that did not keep him from continuously trying.</p>

      <h3>November 23, 879</h3>
      <p>One of Damien’s subjects, Conchobar Eóganacht-Raithlind, finally saw the darkness and converted to the Abyssal faith.</p>
      <h3>February 4, 880</h3>
      <p>Damien Jr. decided that, as the heir to the King, he could do whatever he wanted. However, King Damien quickly put a stop to that.</p>

      <h3>February 27, 880</h3>
      <p>Aliisza had grown to the point that she needed a guardian two years ago; now it was Donncuan’s turn. King Damien decided to take Donncuan as his own ward, right alongside Damien Jr.</p>

      <p>It is now a time of peace in the Abyssal realm. But will that peace last?</p>    </div>
