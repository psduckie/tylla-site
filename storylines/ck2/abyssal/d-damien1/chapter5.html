      <h3>July 26, 880</h3>
      <p>
        Still angry that he did not control Ormond, Damien once again sent his
        troops into the county.

      <h3>September 10, 880</h3>
      <p>
        With the Abyssal forces tied up in Ormond, the Count of Leinster decided
        that he would make a better King than Damien. Obviously, Damien wouldn’t
        give up his throne, so he was now fighting on two fronts.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Though the Abyssal army managed to rout Ormond’s forces, every single
        Abyssal soldier was slaughtered by the superior numbers of Leinster.

      />
      <p>
        As Leinster’s army laid siege to Damien’s castle, he prayed to the Devil
        for some way to drive them back. But none came.

      <p>
        The Abyssal realm was no more. Damien went into exile, changing his name
        back to the name he was born with. His descendants would practice the
        Abyssal faith in secret, and eventually would travel to America. One of
        them would work to start an Abyssal mission in a psychiatric hospital;
        Nine Helps Mental Hospital would never be the same.
