      <h3>June 6, 2006 - Somewhere in the midwest United States</h3>
      <p>
        It was Damien del Dia's sixteenth birthday, and he had just gotten his
        learner's permit. Granted, he had gotten some driving practice in
        private parking lots, but now he was ready to practice driving on public
        roads. Damien's father was working at the Nine Helps Mental Hospital,
        and it was almost the end of his shift. With his mother in the passenger
        seat, Damien set out for the hospital, excited to use his new learner's
        permit to pick his father up from work.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, that was not to be. When Damien reached the parking lot at Nine
        Helps, he drove too quickly into the parking space he had chosen. The
        family car crashed head-on into a well cap. Damien's mother was shaken,
        but Damien himself was not so lucky.
      </p>
      <h3>Hell</h3>
      <p>
        Damien woke up. He knew that he had been in a car accident, but he was
        definitely not in the car anymore. Had he been thrown from the car? No,
        he was wearing his seatbelt when the crash happened. Suddenly, he heard
        a deep voice call to him.
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Damien del Dia...welcome to hell.&quot;</p>
      <p>
        &quot;No...this can't be...&quot; Damien was a practicing Catholic; he
        couldn't be in hell! He just couldn't!
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;It can be and it is.&quot; The voice was getting closer; Damien
        started to pray, hoping that it wasn't who he thought it was.
      </p>
      <p>But it was who he thought it was. It was the Devil himself.</p>
      <p>
        &quot;I've been waiting for you to come here, Damien del Dia. Your
        father is one of my greatest agents in this time.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>&quot;My father would never work for you!&quot;</p>
      <p>
        &quot;Oh, but he does! Your family has been on my side for over a
        thousand years. I'd like to make you a deal, Damien del Dia.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>&quot;No, Satan. I will never deal with you.&quot;</p>
      <p>
        &quot;Fine, then. I guess I'll have to torment you in hell for all
        eternity. Or until you see things your family's way.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>Three hours later</p>
      <p>The torment had broken Damien. &quot;What is it you want?&quot;</p>
      <p>
        &quot;I will send you back in time to 867. There, you will build a
        kingdom in my name!&quot;
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Me...a king! I like that idea!&quot;</p>
      <p>
        &quot;Then go. Take up your family's ancestral name...Damien del
        Diablo.&quot;
