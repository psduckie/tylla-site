# The Darkdusk Legacy – Chapter 1: Reality Check
### October 28, 2012

Kelly finds a suitable building to start their house…that is, suitable once Cyrus finishes some remodeling work.  All of the windows are removed and destroyed, and a second floor is added above the bedroom.  The final result:

Unfortunately, the remodeling takes up most of the stolen money, and both Darkdusks have to get part-time jobs.  Kelly despises this fact, thinking herself above working as a receptionist, but recognizes that the Darkdusk house will fall before it gets a chance to rise if she does not do this.  Cyrus, on the other hand, had always been treated as a second-class citizen in the Realm of Night, and as such is used to working low-paying jobs.

After getting their jobs, Kelly and Cyrus go to the gym.  Kelly works out, and Cyrus practices his speech in the mirror.  Although Kelly’s Vampire nature has not developed fully, it has developed to the point where she and Cyrus can tone their bodies and practice their speech faster than Humans.

The two aspiring nobles also have to go to school with the Humans.  Again, Kelly is upset.

[Kelly] “Why do I, a noble heiress, have to go to the same school as these…”

[Cyrus] “It’s the perfect cover while we develop our house.”  
[Kelly] “I suppose you have a point there.”

After coming home from work, Kelly and Cyrus know they should work on their homework to build said cover, but they are just too tired.  Even a Vampire has to sleep, after all.

When they wake up, however…

After finishing his homework, Cyrus decides to test out his Vampiric body.  After all, if the house comes under attack, it is his job to protect Kelly and any daughters they might have.

After all that, the two Darkdusks are able to watch some TV before school.

[Cyrus] “The TV in this Realm is terrible; it’s actually funny how bad it is!”  
[Kelly] “Yeah.  Doesn’t anyone own any good entertainers?”

As Cyrus is about to respond, the bus comes.

[Kelly and Cyrus] “Remember, look normal.”

Kelly and Cyrus are actually amazed by what they learned in school: slavery, an accepted institution in the Realm of Night, is illegal in the Realm of Dusk and had been for decades.  Even the people they had seen on TV earlier that day are free and working for money!

On the way home, Kelly decides to try her mind-controlling powers on the Human bus driver.  She figures that she needs to hone those skills, but he just drops the busload of students off at a random spot.

Kelly does get some amusement, however, as a Werewolf runaway from her home Realm chases a young Human woman with skin pale enough that she could be mistaken for a Vampire down the sidewalk.

That amusement is lost when Kelly gets home and does something she’s never done before: taking out the trash.  She finds this extremely aggravating.  Why does she have to do it?

Because she doesn’t have anyone to do it for her, that’s why!  Cyrus is off at work, and the house is starting to smell.  This is a serious reality check for Kelly; building a house is a lot harder than it seemed back in the Realm of Night.

A few days later, Kelly experiences another first: a Realm of Dusk full moon.  She knew from her history class back in the Realm of Night that the Realm of Dusk had been the site of a battle between the Vampires and the Fairies, and that weapons from that battle are still rumored to exist.  Well, they exist.  Kelly just saw them, and though the Zombies were created to attack Fairies, these Zombies seem content to feast on Vampire brains!

[Kelly] “Got to get to the car…”  
[Zombie] “Brains…”

Will Kelly live through this Zombie attack?  And what about Cyrus?  Is he safe?  Find out next time on *Realm of Dusk*!
