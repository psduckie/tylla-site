# The Darkdusk Legacy – Generation 2 Rolls and Traits

Even though generation 2 is still several chapters away, I’m sharing the rolls and some traits now.  I’ll update this post as I’m able to share more without giving anything away.  Note that I am not sharing who the heir is.  This is because I have not decided yet. Here are the rolls and traits for Generation 2:

+ **Family Structure:** Couple + Friend
+ **Number of Children:** Two
+ **Primary Income (1):** Medical
+ **Primary Income (2):** Private Investigator
+ **Secondary Income:** None
+ **Generation Goal:** AWESOME!
+ **Miscellaneous Fun:** Homemade

The AWESOME for this generation is unknown, as is the heir, since my computer died before the heir could take over.

Maria's and Maya's traits were as follows, as of the computer death:

**Maria Darkdusk’s first three traits:**

+ Perceptive
+ Heavy Sleeper
+ Athletic

**Maya Darkdusk’s first two traits:**

+ Grumpy
+ Genius
