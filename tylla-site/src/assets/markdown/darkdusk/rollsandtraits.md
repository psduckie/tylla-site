# The Darkdusk Legacy - Generation 1 Rolls and Traits
### *October 28, 2012*

I’m starting generation 1 midway through the teen stage; however, subsequent generations will start at YA as normal.  Anyway, the rolls for the first generation are:

+ **Family Structure:** Couple
+ **Number of Children:** Four
+ **Primary Income:** Fortune Teller (Mystic)
+ **Secondary Income:** Acrobat
+ **Generation Goal:** AWESOME!
+ **Miscellaneous Fun:** Hands Off

The couple, of course, is Kelly and Cyrus.  Kelly is going to get the Fortune Teller job, and Cyrus is going to get the Acrobat job.

The AWESOME for this generation is founding a new Vampire house earlier than is traditional.  That is mostly complete; however, Kelly and Cyrus still need to have a daughter without using watermelons (they don’t work on Vampires) in order to complete the AWESOME.

Kelly’s and Cyrus’ traits are as follows:

**Kelly Darkdusk’s traits:**

+ Rebellious
+ Snob
+ Evil
+ Ambitious
+ Grumpy

**Cyrus Darkdusk’s traits:**

+ Kleptomaniac
+ Frugal
+ Evil
+ Daredevil
+ Natural Cook
