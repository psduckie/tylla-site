# The Darkdusk Legacy – Prologue
### October 25, 2012

<div class="alert">NOTE: This takes place before the challenge begins, and in a different town.</div>

The Realm of Night is a dark place, ruled by Vampire noble houses.  One of the strongest of those houses is the Sorenson house.

From left to right in the picture, the Sorenson nobles are: Donna Sorenson, the leader of the house; Desirae Sorenson, Donna’s elder daughter and second-in-command; Kelly Sorenson, Donna’s younger daughter; and Roberto Sorenson, Desirae’s and Kelly’s father.  Roberto holds only a tenuous claim to nobility, as he is related to Donna not by blood, but by marriage.

Traditionally, the eldest daughter takes over leadership of the house upon the death of the old leader.  This tradition has created an enmity between Desirae and Kelly over the years.  When Donna tells Kelly that she will have to fully develop as a Vampire before she can have a position in the Sorenson organization, it pushes Kelly to the breaking point.

Kelly, though, is not the type to simply lash out at her superiors, which is what the other Sorenson nobles (with the possible exception of Roberto, but Kelly did not want to risk angering her mother by attacking him) are at this point.  Instead, she takes a notebook and pencil identical to the ones she uses to aid in her development and writes something else – the foundations for a master plan of her own.  As far as Kelly is concerned, she doesn’t need the Sorensons.  The Barriers between the Realms are broken; the Realm of Dusk is ripe for conquest.  All she needs now is the appropriate mate and the appropriate opportunity.

Kelly finds that mate in Cyrus Best, a Human immigrant from the Realm of Dusk that has as much of a capability for evil as she does.  Ideally, he would be a Vampire like her, but a quick bite fixes that problem.  The opportunity comes at daybreak, as the underage Vampires have not yet developed an aversion to sunlight.  They steal §18,500 from the Sorensons, make a break for the Barrier separating the Realm of Night from the Realm of Dusk and soon, they are on their way.  No longer Kelly Sorenson and Cyrus Best, they are now Kelly and Cyrus Darkdusk, founding a new house to conquer the Realm of Dusk!

The challenge starts now.
