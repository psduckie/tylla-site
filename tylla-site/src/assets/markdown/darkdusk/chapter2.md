Kelly and Cyrus get away from the Zombies, and make it home safely.  However, with all the chaos of the Zombie attack, they forget to do their homework!  Luckily, they have established themselves as such good “students” that that didn’t matter for Cyrus.  Kelly, on the other hand, is the victim of an accusation of academic dishonesty.  The accusation is false, of course; it is simply a racist student trying to attack the new Vampire in class.  That said, Kelly does have to sit through an after-school lecture on why cheating is wrong while the school staff sort through the mess.  This lecture makes her late for work, and her boss is not pleased.

[Boss] “You’re late!  I hope you have a good excuse.”  
[Kelly] “As a matter of fact, I do.  It’s called, ‘I quit.’”  
[Boss] “Fine.  Just please finish this shift.”

Meanwhile, Cyrus is up to something at his job as well.  Kelly has always complained about how they can’t afford an alchemy table, and Cyrus knows that the bookstore has just gotten some books on alchemy in stock.  Using the money he earns that day – money the house desperately needs – he buys the book.  Since he is an employee, they even throw in free gift wrapping.

[Cyrus] “I can’t wait to see the look on Kelly’s face!”

[Kelly] “I love it!”

The next day is the last day of school.  Kelly and Cyrus go and say goodbye to their classmates; their development as Vampires is almost complete.  All that is required now is to ritually complete the development.  As Kelly and Cyrus walk to the refrigerator, Kelly explains the ritual to Cyrus.

[Kelly] “This cake is made from the Plasma fruit.  When you eat it, you become a full-fledged Vampire!”  
[Cyrus] “Aren’t I a Vampire now?”  
[Kelly] “You are, but your Vampiric powers are still developing.  The Plasma fruit is needed to finish the development.”

Cyrus eats the cake and…

However, the cake doesn’t have any effect on Kelly, as its ritual power is expended after completing the development of one Vampire, and Cyrus’ Vampirism had developed faster than Kelly had anticipated.  Cyrus quits his job at the bookstore, thinking that, as a fully developed Vampire, he can get a better-paying adult job.

The next day, Kelly tries the ritual again with another cake.  This time, it works.

Now that Kelly and Cyrus are fully developed, how will they lead their lives?  Or un-lives, as the case may be.  Find out next time on *Realm of Dusk*!
