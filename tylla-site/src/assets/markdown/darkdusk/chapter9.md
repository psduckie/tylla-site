### October 4, 2013

Kelly starts to teach Maya the ways of the Vampire. Maya is a quick learner.

The next day, Kelly and Cari get ready to cross over to the Realm of Night.

[Cari] “It’s time to end the Sorenson threat once and for all!”

And, with Cari’s expertise, they cross over safely. The two land near a house in a dark corner of the Realm of Night.

[Kelly] “We made it…”  
[Cari] “Something’s not right, though. The Realm is deteriorating.”  
[Kelly] “We’ll worry about that later. Let’s find Donna and your son.”

As the duo travel closer and closer to the Sorenson mansion, the signs of the Realm’s deterioration get worse and worse. Finally they make it there, to be greeted by a young Human man.

[???] “Mother? Is that you?”  
[Cari] “Yes, it’s me. I’ve come to get you out of here.”  
[Cari’s son] “That’s not going to be easy. Once the Sorensons see I’m gone…”

Before he can finish the sentence, Donna Sorenson comes out to see what’s going on.

[Donna] “Kelly Sorenson. How nice of you to return. Please, come in.”  
[Kelly] “I think I will.”

Within seconds, Donna Sorenson is dead.

[Desirae] “Dear sister, thank you so much for aiding me in my ascension. Allow me to repay you.”  
[Cari (whispering to Kelly)] “Quick…let’s find him and leave!”  
[Kelly (whispering to Cari)] “Right!”

[Cari] “We’re too late. I can sense it…he’s…dead.”  
[Kelly] “We’d better get out of here! Desirae will kill us next!”

And they did indeed leave the Sorenson mansion, crossing immediately back to the Realm of Dusk.

[Cari] “I can’t believe she did that…”  
[Kelly] “Desirae is never without a plan. I’ve spent enough time around her to know that.”  
[Cari] “I’m more concerned about the state of the Realm of Night. I need to do some research on why it’s that way. I might be making a huge mistake by asking this of you, but I have no other choice. Could you take care of my daughter while I find out what’s going on?”  
[Kelly] “Sure.” *Now I have a way to control her…*

What is Desirae’s plan? Why is the Realm of Night falling apart? And is Cari making a mistake by trusting Kelly? Find out next time on *Realm of Dusk*!
