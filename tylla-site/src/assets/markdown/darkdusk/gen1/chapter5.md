As Kelly and Cyrus sleep later that night, Donna’s mixture permeates the air of the Realm of Dusk, altering the memories and desires of the inhabitants.  Luckily for the Darkdusks, they seem to be mostly unaffected, as do people’s memories of them.

After she wakes up, Kelly works on upgrading the toilet.  She doesn’t finish before Cyrus wakes up, grabs a bite to eat, and gets the mail.  In the mail, he finds membership certificates from the local gym.  He goes to hang them, along with his diploma and school award, up on the wall, but the Lord of Dusk intervenes.

Cyrus: “Okay…maybe that wasn’t such a good idea.”

Kelly and Cyrus then decide to try for an heir.

At work, Daydream Ivy is now Kelly’s boss at the Duskwood Fortune-Telling Agency, thanks to Donna’s mixture.  Kelly does get some new clients, though: Ronnie Gates and Bailey Swain.  For his part, Cyrus looks at his schedule and notices that he has one more performance than he remembers having.  Of course, he does marvelously.

When Kelly gets home from work, she sits down and reads.  However, she doesn’t feel well, and soon leaves the book to get sick.  Could it be?

Kelly waters the garden, awaiting the bump that she hopes will come.

And…

#### It comes!
Kelly invites Daydream and Bailey over for a party to celebrate.  (She invites Ronnie, also, but he can’t make it.)  Bailey even brings lobster!

Daydream starts playing guitar and everyone but Cyrus (who’s smart enough to stay out of the Realm of Dusk sun) comes outside and listens.  Now that she knows why Kelly wasn’t at work that day, Daydream gives Kelly her pay and puts her on a week paid leave, which Kelly happily accepts.

During the pregnancy, Cyrus tries to make Kelly feel comfortable.  He does all the heavy work, leaving Kelly to relax.  They both hope for a healthy daughter to carry on the Darkdusk legacy.

Despite the risk, Cyrus does make a grocery run; he knows that Kelly prefers plasma fruit to juice.  A policeman is standing in front of the store.

[Policeman] “Sorry, we can’t let you in.  This store is closed right now.”

Cyrus ignores the policeman and runs in anyway.  The store has already been burglarized – but by someone other than Kelly!  Kelly only steals plasma fruit; this burglar stole aspirin and laundry detergent while leaving the plasma fruit alone.  Cyrus runs to the produce section, steals some plasma fruits, and runs out of the store in less than thirty seconds.  In five minutes, he loses the police, and in ten, he is back to Kelly.

Meanwhile, Kelly goes out (in the sun again!  Won’t she ever learn?) and harvests her garden.  Cyrus doesn’t have the skill to do this.  It turns out to be the first and only harvest that she will ever get from these plants, as the full moon returns, and with it, the Zombies.  This time, they eat her plants, leaving nothing but dead husks.

The Zombies don’t make it inside the Darkdusk house, and baby Maria is born the next day.

[Desirae] “It didn’t work!  I don’t understand why it didn’t work!  I mixed everything perfectly and it still didn’t work!  Unless…”</div>

Will baby Maria grow up well?  Will Kelly replant her lost garden?  And who stole the aspirin and laundry detergent from the grocery store?  Find out next time on *Realm of Dusk*!
