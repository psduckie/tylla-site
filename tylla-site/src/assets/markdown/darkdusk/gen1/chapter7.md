### December 8, 2012

Later that night, Cyrus and Maria have a bit of fun playing together.

The next night, Kelly isn’t feeling all that well as she cleans up the dirty dishes from Maria’s birthday party.  Maybe she ate a bad plasma fruit?  On top of that, the sink is broken!  Kelly fixes the sink and finishes cleaning up the dishes, only to find the toilet broken.  She is not having a good night!

As Cyrus goes to the park to perform, Kelly tries unsuccessfully to fix the toilet.  She is still feeling sick, and reminds herself to check for bad plasma fruit next time she robs the grocery store.  Finally, a sound from upstairs takes Kelly’s attention away from the toilet.  It’s Maria, who had been sleeping and is now awake.

Kelly can’t understand what Maria is saying, and so teaches the young Vampire how to talk.

Later that night, Kelly learns why she was feeling sick earlier.  She’s pregnant again; Maria is going to have a younger sibling.  Both Kelly and Cyrus hope for another daughter.  Maria is too young to know the consequences of either gender; if she were old enough to know, she would probably have hoped for a son.

The next day, Kelly sits down at the TV, and she is amazed by what she sees.

[Host] “And we’re back at the 48th Annual Realm of Dusk Entertainment Awards!”  
[Co-Host] “That’s right.  And now, the award for Best Acrobat goes to…”  
[Host] “The Great Darkness!!!”

Kelly, unsure about what she just saw, turns off the TV.  She knew Cyrus was good, but the best in the Realm?

Meanwhile, at the park, an elderly woman is enjoying Cyrus’ performance.  It is the last performance she will ever enjoy; she dies happily of old age.

As Cyrus mourns the old woman’s death, Maria plays with a new toy, a doll named Cosmo.  Kelly wonders where the doll came from; she didn’t buy it.  Maybe Cyrus did?

The next morning, Kelly feels the familiar pains that signal the coming of the baby.  Unwilling to give birth in the house this time, she and Cyrus rush to the hospital, hiring a babysitter to take care of Maria.

Kelly and Cyrus come home several hours later with baby Maya.  However, Maya isn’t the only Darkdusk child having a birthday that day; it’s also Maria’s birthday!  Maya’s birth leaves no time for a party; the Darkdusks simply perform the ritual and Maria grows into a child Vampire.

Meanwhile, at the border with the Realm of Night…

[???] “Once I place this stone, the Vampires will be no more.”

The agent digs a small hole in the ground, and places the stone into the hole.  As the stone settles in, the sun’s rays grow stronger…

Will the Darkdusks survive this new assault?  Will they finally find out the identity of the agent?  And how will Maria and baby Maya grow up in this changed world?  Find out next time on *Realm of Dusk*!
