# The Darkdusk Legacy – Chapter 3: Start of the Plan
### October 30, 2012

The first thing the two now-fully-developed Vampires do is marry in a private ceremony in their kitchen.  Their house isn’t known yet, so there is no need for a party.

They also start working on Kelly’s plan to influence the people of the Realm of Dusk.  Kelly becomes a fortune teller, giving readings that always benefit the Darkdusk house.  For his part, Cyrus uses his Vampiric athletic skills to become “The Great Darkness,” an acrobat that will take the stage by storm, bringing in much-needed Simoleons while also making the Darkdusk name more known.  The plan is in motion.  However, Cyrus has his first (well, his first as a fully-developed Vampire) encounter with the Realm of Dusk’s sun, which he finds to be quite painful to Vampiric skin.  He makes a note that future Darkdusks will need to do something about that once they take over the Realm.

As soon as he gets home, he starts practicing.

That night, something interrupts Kelly’s rest.  It’s a phone call, but not any ordinary phone call: one from the Realm of Night!  It’s Donna Sorenson!

[Kelly] “Mother?”  
[Donna] “I know you call yourself Kelly Darkdusk now, but you’re still Kelly Sorenson to me.  As long as you know your place, you’ll be fine.”  
[Kelly] “I’m the leader of my own house now.  We can be friends or not; it’s your choice.”  
[Donna] “As long as you stay in your own Realm, we can be friends, Kelly Sorenson.” *click*

The next day, Kelly and Cyrus go to the school one last time, this time for their graduation ceremony.  Both of them graduate with honors, as they expected.  Kelly is voted Most Likely to Take Over the Realm, and Cyrus is voted Most Likely to Save the Realm.

This worries Kelly.  Her own husband, who is just as evil as she is, could save the Realm from her?  To what end?

The Great Darkness’ first performance is a success, and Cyrus Darkdusk becomes a minor celebrity.  Still, he thinks the performance could have gone better.  Cyrus continues to put on performances and bring in Simoleons for the Darkdusk house.  Kelly, on the other hand, isn’t doing as well with her fortune-telling.

One night, Kelly discovers a Fairy that had been run over by a car in a parking lot.  Being the heartless and evil Vampire that she is, she turns and walks away.

Knowing that plasma fruit would be a better plasma substitute than plasma juice until the Darkdusks got some minions to drink from, Kelly purchases a gardening book from Cyrus’ old bookstore after walking away from the distressed Fairy.  This book takes longer to read than the alchemy book did, and it has nothing about plasma fruit in it!  What a waste!

After finishing the book, Kelly decides to try her luck anyway.  The only question is, where to find plasma fruit seeds?  She goes to the grocery store to look for the seeds and finds actual plasma fruit!

[Cashier] “You have to pay for those!”  
[Kelly] “No, I don’t.” *shows teeth*  
[Cashier] “Okay, okay!  I get your point!”

Luckily for Kelly, the grocery store doesn’t call the police.  After the robbery, Kelly tells Cyrus about the crime.

What will Cyrus do about the robbery?  Will Kelly be able to plant the plasma fruit?  And what is Donna up to?  Find out next time on *Realm of Dusk*!
