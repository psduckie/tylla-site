As I entered the graveyard (fresh air, at last!) I heard a voice calling out. It definitely wasn’t one of the vampires; I knew those voices too well. I looked towards the voice and saw an old man tending the graveyard.

“Hey, kid! What are you doing there?”

“Are they still following me?”

“Who?”

“The vampires!”

“Don’t be silly, kid! There’s a ward that keeps this town vampire-free! Come to think of it, I haven’t seen you around. I’m Dampe.”

“I’m Duncan. Where am I, exactly? I need to get home!”

“You’re in Dragon Valley, kid. Far west of SimNation. And I doubt there would be any ‘home’ for you to go back to. Most of SimNation’s now a vampire-filled mess.”

I realized the town I once knew was gone. And my face showed it.

“Is there any place I can stay? Being here in this town would be better than out there with the vampires.”

“Sure, kid. There’s an old abandoned house at 81 Claddagh Court. No one’s lived there for decades. I doubt anyone would mind if you stayed there.”

“Thanks, Dampe!”

“No problem, kid. By the way, if you need some money, come by here tomorrow. I could use a helper here at the graveyard.”

I walked across town to the address that Dampe had mentioned and found the abandoned house. It was old, all right. Old and a complete mess. At least it was better than that vampire cave.

Man, it was nice to sleep in a real bed.

The next day, I went to the school to register as a student. They immediately had a class for me to join! I got to meet some of the other students, but I was mostly focused on my studies and my job at the graveyard. One of my classmates was a really hot girl…her name was Sophie.

Two days after I joined the class, the teacher told us that there would be no class the next day because of a festival. That festival could be the perfect chance to get to know Sophie!
