# The Nightmagic Legacy – Bonus Chapter: How Tyla Met Duncan
### March 2, 2014

*Yes, I know I said I’d introduce Generation 2 in the next chapter, and I still plan on doing so in Chapter 6. But some game glitchiness kept me from being able to take the pictures for Chapter 6 today, so here’s a bonus chapter from Tyla’s point of view. It starts during the Prologue and shows how the two met, as well as some backstory. Enjoy. -Tyll'a*

How did I, princess of the vampires, end up living in Dragon Valley with a human man?

I’m Tylarael K’ien’sha, and this is my story.

It all started when I was just a fledgling. I was an only child, and my mother the Queen had just successfully led an invasion of the human town of Appaloosa Plains. I had been trying to find someone to play with for a while at that point, so when she gave me a captured human boy, I was extremely happy. His name was Duncan, and we became close friends. That is, until mother sold him three years later. I was upset, but I couldn’t do anything about it. After all, she was the Queen.

I grew to see what was wrong with vampire society and eventually, I heard that Duncan had escaped. I realized that I missed him and worked to figure out where he went, so I could be with him once again…
