# The Nightmagic Legacy – Chapter 2: Sophie
### December 20, 2013

The day of the festival arrived. I called Sophie to see if she wanted to meet up at the festival grounds.

“I’m sorry, Duncan. My mother wouldn’t approve of us being together.”

I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t even know what exactly was going on.

“I don’t know how it works where you’re from, but here in Dragon Valley, the parents have to sanction relationships. I’m sorry. I really am.”

An hour or so later, I got my mail. There was a letter from Dampe:

> Duncan:
>
> Enjoy the festival! You don’t have to come into work today.
>
> -Dampe

Enjoying the festival is exactly what I did.

After the festival, I decided to go to the gym.

When I went to school the next day, I tried to forget about what happened with Sophie before the festival. But it was still on my mind.

The next day was a Saturday, so I didn’t have school. At least that was the same. But the old TV in the house was broken, so I had to do what I could to fix it.

I did, however, have work. Work was the same as always.
