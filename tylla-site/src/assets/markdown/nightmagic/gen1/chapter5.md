# The Nightmagic Legacy – Chapter 5: Tyla
### February 10, 2014

“Duncan?”

It was her! My one and only friend during my time with the vampires! But what was she doing in Dragon Valley?

“What are you doing here, Tyla? Why are you not with your family?”

“I can’t take being with them anymore. You know just as well as I do what they’re like! I want to be with you!”

“Won’t your mother be looking for you?”

“I told her I was going to look for you and bring you back. But I’m not going to do that! I didn’t realize what you mean to me until you escaped!”

Did Tyla just admit she had feelings for me? I definitely had feelings for her.

I thought a moment. Then I remembered something that Dampe had told me: if I took responsibility for any misdeeds Tyla committed (of which there would be none – this is Tyla we are talking about, after all), she can stay. “You can stay at my house, Tyla.”

“Thank you so much, Duncan!”

I had work soon after that, and the spirits were hiding from me this time. It didn’t work.

They were also getting stronger!

As the days went on, the spirits got harder and harder to stop. By the time I could go home to Tyla, I was too tired to do anything except sleep!

Finally, the Love Day festival came. No work! I was able to spend the day with Tyla! One thing led to another…

Two days later, Tyla told me the good news over a game of chess.

“I’m pregnant.”

The question stuck in my mind: would our child be a vampire like Tyla?
